# Two Types of Executive Function

There are [two types of executive function](https://youtu.be/rC3tG3lbrNM?t=108): **cool** and **hot**.

The hot system is activated "in the heat of the moment" while the cool one is activated when working on things "ahead of time."

It's easier to make better decisions when making use of the cool system.

This is especially relevant for people with [[ADHD Executive Function|ADHD: an executive function disorder]].
