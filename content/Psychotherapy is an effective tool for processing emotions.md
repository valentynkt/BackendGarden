# Psychotherapy is an effective tool for processing emotions

Since we [[We grow mentally ill due to unprocessed trauma|grow ill due to not being able to think about or confront certain aspects of ourselves]], psychotherapy's job is to make the patient feel comfortable enough to access the parts of themselves that are too painful.

In order for this to work, it's important to feel safe enough to share whatever happens to enter one's mind. It is only through this [[Judging Ideas|acceptance of all thoughts]] that we can learn to [[Accept yourself for who you are|accept ourselves]].

[[Psychedelics can help with the goals of psychotherapy|Psychedelics are a tool that can enhance the experience]] and perhaps get past mental blocks more easily.
