By allowing individuals to save content for later consumption, [[Read It Later Apps Help Manage Information Overload|"Read It Later" apps]] enable [[Information Overload Is a Progress Trap|effective filtering]] of information. This time-shifting of the reading process has several benefits:

1. It allows an initial assessment of the content's value without the pressure to fully engage with it immediately.
2. Upon later review, many saved items are discarded as no longer relevant or valuable, saving time.
3. The items that make the cut can be consumed with [[Focused Attention Is Scarce and Valuable|full attention]] at a time of the individual's choosing.

This separation of content intake from consumption yields a powerful filtering effect, helping readers save time and focus only on the information that *truly matters* to them. It's an essential strategy for thriving in an information-saturated world.
