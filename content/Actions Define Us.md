[[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|Thoughts are powerful]]. They control our perspective of the world which impacts our behavior and ultimately who we are.

But thoughts are not what define us -- at least not if we can make conscious choices about them. The thoughts and ideas we *choose* to incorporate into our personal narrative — the "story of us" — are what ultimately define who we are.

While [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|discovering our inner selves]] is very important, it's important in the sense that it will help us understand *our actions*. It's important to *own our behavior*.

We all [[ADHD|have challenges]] we must overcome to understand and take full responsibility for ourselves. These obstacles are **not our fault**, but they *are* our **responsibility**. How we [[Positive social connections keep us healthy|relate to others]] and [[Accept yourself for who you are|ourselves]] matters.
