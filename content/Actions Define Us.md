> The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

We are not [[No bad thoughts in a Zettelkasten|defined by our thoughts]]. **What we do** is what defines **who we are**.

> We aren’t defined by our intentions or our thoughts; we’re defined by what we do. Our actions.

While [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|discovering our inner selves]] is very important, it's important in the sense that it will help us understand *our actions*. It's important to *own our behavior*.

We all [[How I deal with ADHD|have challenges]] we must overcome to understand and take full responsibility for ourselves. These obstacles are **not our fault**, but they *are* our **responsibility**. How we [[Positive social connections keep us healthy|relate to others]] and [[Accept yourself for who you are|ourselves]] matters.

Taking ownership of ourselves means [[No bad thoughts in a Zettelkasten|not judging our thoughts]] and instead [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|yearning to understand]] where they come from so that we can ultimately grow and become more in tune with [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|what drives our behavior]].
