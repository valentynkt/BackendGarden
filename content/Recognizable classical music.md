This is my non-exhaustive list of classical music that invokes nostalgia and particular emotions:

* Piano Sonata No. 11
* Lux Aeterna  (requiem for a dream)

Song | Artist | Emotion
----- | ------ | -------
Requiem | Mozart | This dramatic and intense piece has been used in many movies to convey a sense of foreboding or ominousness.
Allegretto | Beethoven | Dramatic uneasy feeling building up to something not right.
