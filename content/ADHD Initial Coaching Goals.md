[[VIA Character Profile.pdf|VIA Character Assessment]]

---

###### What do you think are your strengths? What are you good at? Skills? Talents? What is going well for you right now? Do not be modest.

I'm good at "figuring things out." I try to understand a system before I go to make changes to it. I have to infer what the person who created the system was trying to achieve. I then evaluate if my goals match theirs and once I understand how it all works, I go make changes and make it the way I want to be.

Traditionally, I've only really thought about how I do this in the context of work (software development). But I think I do it in all areas of life. Especially in social situations, I'm realizing now how much effort I apply to appear "normal" and act in a way where people won't think I'm "weird."

Right now, I'm trying to figure out the YouTube algorithm and I feel like I want to and can conquer it.

###### Where would you like to see yourself in one year? If all goes well, what would your life look like? Accomplishments? How would it be different from your life now? (We cannot predict the future and events out of our control. This is to have a sense of direction for progress.)

I've always been passionate about my work (software development) but I've found I lack motivation lately. I don't know if I want to get that motivation back. I don't know why we as a society have to pick one thing to do the rest of our lives.

I think I'd like to get into more creative projects (like film making - I mean dumb youtube videos, not like making movies or anything). I really enjoy that and am doing it as an obsessive hobby right now. I don't know if there is a way to find balance with the things that pay the bills or if I should just go all in and not worry about such materialistic things.

---

###### What are your goals for five years from now?

I want to find fulfillment which is where I feel most lacking right now. I've spent a lot of time and effort building a life I'm not even sure I want anymore.

Right now, I'm finding fulfillment in making videos.

---

###### For 10 years from now? Dream big. Go crazy. Do not place any limitations on your imagination.

I'd like to find a way to continue to do whatever the hell I want (follow the dopamine) but still get paid somehow. I feel like if I can harness YouTube, it could be the perfect outlet for that.

10 years from now, if I was doing YouTube fulltime, I think that's the direction I'd like to head toward.

---

###### Scale back. What do you need to do this week? What absolutely has to be completed by this time next week? Add real life tasks too (eating, sleeping, personal hygiene, commuting, etc.)

Ughhh. I need to do some work and finish some projects at my job (which actually pays the bills). I have to do taxes. I need to finish mowing the lawn (I did half of it and then left it for a week cuz my battery died). I need to go to the grocery. There are some broken light switches in the house (due to a power surge like 4 months ago). I've resigned to just not having lights in those rooms rather than fixing it.

---

###### What do you want to do this week?

I want to finish the video I'm working on for my YT channel.

---

###### Go back and estimate how long you think these activities will take. When can you complete them? Is it a realistic expectation? (This activity is a first step to building awareness.)

Do work: 6 hours
Mow lawn: 1 hour
Grocery: 2 hours
Fix switches: 2 hours
Finish video: 10 hours

---

###### Finally, on a separate sheet of paper or document, brainstorm a list of everything in life that you value. This can be big abstract concepts or small detailed things. You do not necessarily need to have them in your life at this very moment. This list is private. You will not share it. It is step 1 to an activity we will complete together. Have fun with it and bring it to our first session.
