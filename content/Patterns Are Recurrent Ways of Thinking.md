In a behavioral context, a **pattern** refers to a recurrent way of [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|thinking, feeling, or acting]] that an individual tends to engage in, often automatically or subconsciously.

These patterns can be positive or negative, adaptive or maladaptive. They are typically **deeply ingrained** and can be *challenging* to change.

Examples of patterns include:

- Procrastination
- People-pleasing
- Self-criticism
- Avoidance of difficult emotions
- Overworking

Patterns often develop as coping mechanisms or [[Internalizing Patterns and Symmetries Through Repetition|learned responses]] to particular situations or stimuli. Over time, they become *habitual* and can persist even when they no longer serve the individual's best interests.

[[Cognitive Biases Evolved as Survival Mechanisms|Cognitive biases]] are an example of patterns becoming so ingrained that they affect our evolutionary history.
