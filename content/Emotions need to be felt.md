Emotions tend to come in waves — similar to ocean waves crashing along the beach. If we try to fight the waves, we get splashed in the face and have a generally bad time. If instead we float with the waves letting them pass through us, we can find **peace** until the water eventually becomes calm.

Expressing feelings or emotions involves "letting go" of them — letting them pass. Feelings can be expressed through multiple mediums:

[[Emotional invalidation weakens our relationships|Acknowledging our emotions as valid and understandable]] improves [[Accept yourself for who you are|our relationship with ourselves]] and gets us "past" them.
