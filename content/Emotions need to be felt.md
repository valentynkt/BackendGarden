# Emotions need to be felt

Emotions tend to come in waves — similar to ocean waves crashing along the beach. If we try to fight the waves, we get splashed in the face and have a generally bad time. If instead we float with the waves letting them pass through us, we can find **peace** until the water eventually becomes calm.

Expressing feelings or emotions involves "letting go" of them — letting them pass. Feelings can be expressed through multiple mediums:

- [[Journaling is an effective way to process our emotions|journaling]]
- talking through the emotions in therapy
- [[Art as expression of emotion|feeling them through art]]

If [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|emotions]] are ignored, they can have a "boomerang" effect where they can come back stronger than they were before.

[[Emotional invalidation weakens our relationships|Acknowledging our emotions as valid and understandable]] improves [[Accept yourself for who you are|our relationship with ourselves]] and gets us "past" them.

Feeling emotions can be [[Stages of Grief|very painful]] but it is [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|necessary to live a full life]].

> The simple act of labeling what you’re feeling (without judgement) can help regulate your emotions. Emotions come and go like waves, *if we let them*. The idea here is to ride the wave of emotion instead of trying to stop a giant wave and getting pushed around.

In Taoism, [[Taoism Philosophy|we cannot feel joy without also feeling pain]].
