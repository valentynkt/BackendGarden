## Highlights

> Emotions are considered as our bodies‚Äô responses to external stimuli and feelings are mental associations and reactions to these emotions.

> It is important to know that emotions are considered to be irrational, illogical and unreasonable since they are carried out by the limbic system, which is separate from the neocortex, which deals with reasoning, conscious thoughts, and decision making.
