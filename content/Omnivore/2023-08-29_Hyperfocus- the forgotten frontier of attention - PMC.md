## Highlights

> ‚ÄòHyperfocus‚Äô is a phenomenon that reflects one‚Äôs complete absorption in a task, to a point where a person appears to completely ignore or ‚Äòtune out‚Äô everything else. Hyperfocus is most often mentioned in the context of autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but research into its effect on cognitive and neural functioning is limited. We propose that hyperfocus is a critically important aspect of cognition, particularly with regard to clinical populations, and that it warrants significant investigation.
