## Highlights

> The mind's operation--what happens when the mind is applied, when the mind's capabilities are exercised--involves meeting the demands of new contexts. In a new context, concepts adapt by unfolding into concrete consequences; by widening their scope, in the form of guesses or analogies; and by interfacing with each other in the combinations suitable to the context.
