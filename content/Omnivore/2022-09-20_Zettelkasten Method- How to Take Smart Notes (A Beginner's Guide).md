## Highlights

> **The point of note-taking is to think better**. Capturing is a means to it; retention is merely a side effect. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/zettelkasten-method-how-to-take-smart-notes-a-beginner-s-guide-18abc6c3ac1#d437d200-02ac-42e9-9e6b-9202b672a32b)  ^d437d200

> if there’s meaning in links, they’re _implicit_ at best. That applies well into the _series of links_. For them to be useful in the long run, you have to _capture the meaning_ of these thought trails as soon as possible. (i.e. make them _explicit_ — just like how you turn fleeting notes into zettels) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/zettelkasten-method-how-to-take-smart-notes-a-beginner-s-guide-18abc6c3ac1#e90f9424-b01f-45f3-b19b-628166efeedd)  ^e90f9424
