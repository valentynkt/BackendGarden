## Highlights

> Dopamine neurons monitor the difference between the rewards you thought you would get from a behavior and what you actually got. Neuroscientists call this difference a [reward prediction error](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-05-01936.1996).

> Dopamine neurons communicate reward prediction errors to the brain through their firing rates and patterns of dopamine release, which the brain [uses for learning](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05051). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-inverse-com-health-dopamine-brain-chemical-mood-pleasu-18adb9274e0#0c165bc6-b142-4dac-ad01-22277a2aa2b0)  ^0c165bc6

> There is another way that dopamine release happens: Sometimes, it increases slowly until a desired reward is obtained. Researchers discovered this [ramp pattern](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12475) ten years ago in a part of the brain called the striatum. The steepness of the dopamine ramp tracks how valuable a reward is and how much effort it takes to get it. In other words, it encodes motivation.

> Though dopamine is known for its involvement in [drug addiction](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/drugs-brain), [neurodegenerative disease](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/parkinsons-disease), and [neurodevelopmental conditions](https://theconversation.com/misuse-of-adderall-promotes-stigma-and-mistrust-for-patients-who-need-it-a-neuroscientist-explains-the-science-behind-the-controversial-adhd-drug-198223) like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, recent research suggests how scientists understand its involvement may soon need updating.
