## Highlights

> The fact is, **the ability to read is becoming a source of competitive advantage in the world**. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-1879520e743#05051b6e-e7d7-4371-b42a-075fb35dfeca)  ^05051b6e

The ability to synthesize knowledge (intelligence in other words) is the real competitive advantage.

ADHD people who can hyperfocus shall rule the world in the Intelligence Revolution.

> no matter how stringent I was in the original collecting, no matter how certain I was that this thing was worthwhile, I **regularly eliminate 1/3 of my list before reading** [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-1879520e743#d6c3f564-f6de-4f0d-9322-c8bf4eefaf0d)  ^d6c3f564

Time-separating intake from consumption of content yields a strong filtering effect allowing you to save time and only focus on the things you *actually* care about.

> As the pace of change in the world accelerates, we double down on all the methods that created the problems in the first place ‚Äî more planning, more forecasting, more control and risk management. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-1879520e743#a2c5391b-60cf-49f1-afbd-d806f489ff24)  ^a2c5391b

It's time. It's time to actually try.

> > **If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose.** 
> 
> > It is in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off addictions, live in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or burned at the stake or crucified or shot, and **have impacts that last for millennia**. 
> 
> > In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with **strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.** [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-1879520e743#d722138b-aa22-4a67-bcae-39a7c9d11c57)  ^d722138b
