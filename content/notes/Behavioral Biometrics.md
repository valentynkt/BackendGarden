# Behavioral Biometrics

## Overview

Behavioral Biometrics is a method of authentication that analyzes patterns in a user's behavior to verify their identity. Unlike physical biometrics, which rely on unique physical traits, behavioral biometrics focus on how a user interacts with devices and systems.

## Key Concepts

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Typing Dynamics**: Analyzes typing patterns, such as speed and rhythm, to authenticate users.
> - **Mouse Movement**: Tracks the way a user moves and clicks a mouse.
> - **Gait Analysis**: Studies the user's walking patterns.
> - **Touchscreen Behavior**: Observes how a user interacts with a touchscreen, including pressure and swipe patterns.
> - **Voice Patterns**: Analyzes speech characteristics such as tone, pitch, and pace.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system collects data on the user's behavior during normal interactions.
2. **Profile Creation**: Creates a behavioral profile based on collected data.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitors behavior to detect deviations from the established profile.
4. **Authentication**: Compares current behavior with the stored profile to authenticate the user.
