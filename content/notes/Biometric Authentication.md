# Biometric Authentication

## Overview

Biometric Authentication uses unique physical traits like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify identity, providing high security and ease of use without passwords.

## Types of Biometric Authentication

> [!summary] **Types**
> 
> - **Fingerprint Recognition**: Scans unique patterns on fingertips.
> - **Facial Recognition**: Matches facial features to stored data.
> - **Iris Recognition**: Verifies unique patterns in the eye.
> - **Voice Recognition**: Identifies users by their voice.
> - **Retina Scanning**: Analyzes the blood vessel pattern at the back of the eye.
> - **Hand Geometry**: Measures the shape and size of the hand.
> - **[[Behavioral Biometrics]]**: Analyzes user behavior, like typing rhythm or gait.

## How It Works

1. **Enrollment**: Users provide a biometric sample for initial setup.
2. **Data Storage**: Biometric data is securely stored as a digital template.
3. **Authentication**: Users provide a fresh biometric sample.
4. **Verification**: The system compares the sample with the stored template.
5. **Access Granted**: If matched, access is provided.

## Pros and Cons

> [!success] **Pros**
> 
> - **High Security**: Hard to forge or duplicate.
> - **Convenient**: No need for passwords or physical tokens.
> - **Fast Authentication**: Quick and efficient.

> [!danger] **Cons**
> 
> - **Privacy Concerns**: Risk if biometric data is compromised.
> - **Device Requirements**: Requires special hardware.
> - **Environmental Impact**: Variations can lead to false rejections.
