# Biometric Authentication

## Overview

Biometric Authentication is a [[Passwordless Authentication]] method that uses unique biological characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to verify their identity. This method provides a high level of security by relying on unique physical traits that are difficult to replicate.

## Types of Biometric Authentication

> [!summary] **Types of Biometric Authentication**
> 
> - **Fingerprint Recognition**: Uses unique patterns on an individual's fingertips to authenticate identity.
> - **Facial Recognition**: Analyzes facial features and matches them against stored data.
> - **Iris Recognition**: Scans the unique patterns in the colored ring of the eye.
> - **Voice Recognition**: Identifies individuals based on their unique vocal characteristics.
> - **Retina Scanning**: Examines the unique pattern of blood vessels at the back of the eye.
> - **Hand Geometry**: Measures the shape and size of the hand and fingers.
> - **[[Behavioral Biometrics]]**: Analyzes patterns in the user's behavior, such as typing rhythm or gait.

## How Biometric Authentication Works

1. **Enrollment**: The user provides a biometric sample (e.g., fingerprint, face scan) to the system during the initial setup.
2. **Storage**: The biometric data is converted into a digital template and securely stored.
3. **[[Authentication]] Request**: When the user attempts to log in, they provide a new biometric sample.
4. **Comparison**: The system compares the new sample with the stored template.
5. **Access Granted**: If the samples match, the user is authenticated and granted access.

## Pros and Cons

> [!success] **Pros**
> 
> - **High Security**: Difficult to forge or replicate biometric data.
> - **Convenience**: No need to remember passwords or carry tokens.
> - **Quick Authentication**: Fast and efficient login process.

> [!danger] **Cons**
> 
> - **Privacy Concerns**: Potential risks if biometric data is compromised.
> - **Equipment Requirements**: Requires specialized hardware for capturing biometric data.
> - **False Rejections**: Environmental factors or changes in the user's biometric traits can lead to false rejections.
