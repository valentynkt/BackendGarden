# Web Tokens

## Overview

Web tokens are a mechanism used in web development for securely transmitting information between parties. They are commonly used for [[Authentication]], [[Authorization]], and information exchange. Web tokens can encapsulate various types of claims and metadata, making them versatile tools for ensuring secure and efficient communication in [[Web]] applications.

## Types of Web Tokens

There are several types of web tokens, each with unique features and use cases:

> [!summary]- **Types of Web Tokens**
> 
> - **[[JSON Web Tokens|Json Web Tokens (JWT)]]**: A compact, URL-safe token format that is widely used for authentication and authorization. JWTs contain three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature, and are designed to be self-contained and stateless.
> - **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Tokens**: XML-based tokens used primarily for single sign-on (SSO) in enterprise environments. SAML tokens facilitate the exchange of authentication and authorization data between parties.
> - **OAuth Tokens**: Tokens used in the [[OAuth 2.0]] framework to grant access to resources without sharing user credentials. OAuth tokens can be in the form of access tokens, refresh tokens, or ID tokens (when used with [[OpenID Connect]]).
> - **Simple Web Tokens (SWT)**: A lightweight token format used for authentication and authorization, often replaced by JWTs in modern applications due to the latter's enhanced features.

## How Web Tokens Work

> [!info]- **How Web Tokens Work**
> 
> 1. **Client [[Authentication]]**: The client application sends authentication credentials (e.g., username and password) to the server.
> 2. **Token Issuance**: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a web token and sends it back to the client.
> 3. **Token Storage**: The client stores the token, typically in [[Web Local Storage|Local Storage]] or a [[Web Cookies|cookie]].
> 4. **Token Usage**: For subsequent requests, the client includes the token in the [[Authorization]] header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`).
> 5. **Token Verification**: The server verifies the token's validity before granting access to the requested resources.

## Pros/Cons

> [!success]- **Pros**
> - **Stateless Authentication**: Web tokens enable stateless authentication, improving scalability and reducing server load.
> - **Compact and URL-Safe**: Tokens are small and can be easily transmitted via URLs, POST parameters, or HTTP headers.
> - **Interoperability**: Web tokens can be used across different platforms and technologies, facilitating seamless integration.
> - **Security**: Properly implemented tokens ensure secure communication by encapsulating authentication and authorization data.


> [!danger]- **Cons**
> - **Security Risks**: Storing sensitive information in tokens can be risky. Always encrypt sensitive data and validate tokens on the server side.
> - **Token Revocation**: Revoking tokens can be challenging, especially with stateless tokens like JWTs.
> - **Complexity**: Implementing secure token management and handling can add complexity to the application.

## Use Cases

> [!example]- **Use Cases**
> 
> - **[[Authentication]]**: Tokens are commonly used for user authentication in web and mobile applications.
> - **[[Authorization]]**: Tokens help control access to resources, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions.
> - **Information Exchange**: Securely transmitting information between parties in a compact and standardized format.
