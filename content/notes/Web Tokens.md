# Web Tokens

## Overview

Web tokens are a mechanism used in web development for securely transmitting information between parties. They are commonly used for [[Authentication]], [[Authorization]], and information exchange. Web tokens can encapsulate various types of claims and metadata, making them versatile tools for ensuring secure and efficient communication in [[Web]] applications.


> [!important] Token-Based Authentication
> Token-based authentication is a modern approach to secure user access in web applications and native mobile apps. It addresses some limitations of [[Session-Cookie Authentication]] and offers advantages such as stateless server-side handling and better compatibility with various platforms.

## Types of Web Tokens

There are several types of web tokens, each with unique features and use cases:

> [!summary]- **Types of Web Tokens**
> 
> - **[[JSON Web Tokens|Json Web Tokens (JWT)]]**: A compact, URL-safe token format that is widely used for authentication and authorization. JWTs contain three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature, and are designed to be self-contained and stateless.
> - **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Tokens**: XML-based tokens used primarily for single sign-on (SSO) in enterprise environments. SAML tokens facilitate the exchange of authentication and authorization data between parties.
> - **OAuth Tokens**: Tokens used in the [[OAuth 2.0]] framework to grant access to resources without sharing user credentials. OAuth tokens can be in the form of access tokens, refresh tokens, or ID tokens (when used with [[OpenID Connect]]).
> - **Simple Web Tokens (SWT)**: A lightweight token format used for authentication and authorization, often replaced by JWTs in modern applications due to the latter's enhanced features.

## How Web Tokens Work

> [!info]- **How Web Tokens Work**
> 
>1. The client sends a request to access a protected resource on the server. If the client hasn't yet authenticated, the server responds with a login prompt. The client submits their username and password to the server.
>    
>2. The server verifies the provided credentials and, if valid, issues a unique token.
>    
>3. The token is sent back to the client.
>    
>4. The client stores the token in local storage.Â 
>    
>5. Subsequent requests include the token in the HTTP header.
>    
>6. The server validates the received token.
>    
>7. The server grants access to the requested resource.

## Pros/Cons

> [!success]- **Pros**
> - **Stateless [[Authentication]]**: Web tokens enable stateless authentication, improving scalability and reducing server load.
> - **Compact and URL-Safe**: Tokens are small and can be easily transmitted via URLs, POST parameters, or HTTP headers.
> - **Interoperability**: Web tokens can be used across different platforms and technologies, facilitating seamless integration.
> - **Security**: Properly implemented tokens ensure secure communication by encapsulating authentication and authorization data.


> [!danger]- **Cons**
> - **Security Risks**: Storing sensitive information in tokens can be risky. Always encrypt sensitive data and validate tokens on the server side.
> - **Token Revocation**: Revoking tokens can be challenging, especially with stateless tokens like JWTs.
> - **Complexity**: Implementing secure token management and handling can add complexity to the application.

## Use Cases

> [!example]- **Use Cases**
> 
> - **[[Authentication]]**: Tokens are commonly used for user authentication in web and mobile applications.
> - **[[Authorization]]**: Tokens help control access to resources, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions.
> - **Information Exchange**: Securely transmitting information between parties in a compact and standardized format.
