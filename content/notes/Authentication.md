## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, ensuring that users are who they claim to be. This foundational security measure is essential for web applications and systems, safeguarding sensitive information and enabling controlled access.

## Importance of Authentication

Authentication is vital for securing access, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining data integrity and accountability.

> [!important]
> 
> - **Security**: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
> - **Data Integrity**: Ensures data remains accurate and unaltered.
> - **Accountability**: Tracks user actions for traceability.
> - **User Trust**: Protects personal information, enhancing confidence.

## Authentication Methods

Authentication methods vary, from password-based systems to advanced multi-factor and passwordless options.

> [!summary]
> 
> - **[[Password-Based Authentication]]**: Traditional method using username and password.
>     - **[[HTTP Basic Authentication]]**: Simple credential-passing method.
>     - **[[Session-Cookie Authentication]]**: Manages sessions via cookies.
>     - **[[Web Tokens|Token-Based Authentication]]**: Uses tokens (e.g., [[JSON Web Tokens|JWT]]).
> - **[[Passwordless Authentication]]**: Eliminates passwords by using secure alternatives.
>     - Email links, SMS OTPs, Biometrics, Push Notifications, Hardware Tokens.
> - **[[Multi-Factor Authentication]] (MFA)**: Enhances security by combining multiple methods.
> - **[[Single Sign-On]] (SSO)**: Allows access to multiple applications with one set of credentials.

## How Authentication Works

> [!info] **Authentication Process**
> 
> 1. **User Request**: User attempts access.
> 2. **Credentials Submission**: User provides credentials.
> 3. **Verification**: System checks credentials against stored data.
> 4. **Access Granted**: Valid credentials allow access.
> 5. **Session Management**: Tokens or cookies manage authentication state.

## Best Practices for Authentication

Implementing best practices strengthens authentication security.

> [!important] **Best Practices**
> 
> - **Strong Passwords**: Enforce complexity requirements.
> - **Use MFA**: Adds an extra layer of security.
> - **Secure Token Storage**: Protects tokens during storage and transmission.
> - **Regular Updates**: Ensures the latest security standards.
> - **Monitor and Audit**: Tracks authentication logs for suspicious activity.
