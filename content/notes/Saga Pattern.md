# Saga Pattern

## Diagram

## Overview

The Saga pattern is essential in [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|microservices]] architectures for managing data consistency across multiple services in a distributed transaction. Unlike traditional monolithic applications where a single database transaction can handle changes across multiple tables, microservices often require coordination across several services, each with its own database.

> [!abstract] 
> A saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service and publishes events or messages that trigger the next transaction in the saga.

## Content

### Key Concepts

The Saga pattern provides a way to ensure data consistency across services in a microservices architecture without relying on two-phase commit transactions:

> [!important]
> 
> - **Local Transactions**: Each step in a saga is a local transaction that affects only a single serviceâ€™s data and can be compensated for if a subsequent step in the saga fails.
> - **Compensation Transactions**: If a step in a saga fails, compensating transactions are executed to undo the changes made by the preceding successful steps, maintaining data consistency.
> - **Event/Message-Driven**: Sagas coordinate transactions through a series of domain events or messages, which ensures each transaction is triggered by the completion of the previous one.

### Implementation Overview

Implementing a saga involves:

- **Defining Events and Commands**: Identify and design the events that each service will publish and the commands they will listen for as part of the saga.
- **Handling Failures**: Implement compensation mechanisms for each transaction part of the saga to reverse its effects in case of failure.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Design the system to handle the fact that data consistency is maintained eventually, not immediately, as it relies on the successful completion of all involved transactions.

## Summary

> [!summary] 
> The Saga pattern is a powerful strategy for maintaining data consistency across a distributed system, allowing for complex business transactions to be handled in a microservices architecture. It mitigates the limitations of distributed transactions by ensuring that each service can independently manage its transactions while coordinating with others through events or messages.


> [!note]- Personal Notes
> It reminds me about one of my examples for Design Patterns:
> Combination of two patterns [[Command Pattern]] and [[Memento Pattern|Memento]] - [[Memento Pattern#Examples]]
> And maybe we can even add to this combination [[Chain Of Responsibility Pattern|Chain Of Responsibility]]
> I think Saga Pattern can be achieve using similar approach.
