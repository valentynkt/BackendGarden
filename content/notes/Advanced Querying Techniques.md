# Advanced Querying Techniques

> [!important]- **Window Functions**
> 
> Window functions perform calculations across sets of rows related to the current row, providing powerful analytics capabilities directly in SQL queries.
> 
> - **Functions Include**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, over specified partitions of data.

> [!important]- **Recursive Queries**
> 
> Recursive queries are used for processing hierarchical or nested data structures, such as organizational charts or multi-level categories.
> 
> - **SQL Syntax**: Typically implemented using the `WITH RECURSIVE` clause to facilitate self-referencing queries in SQL.

> [!important]- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
> 
> CTEs allow for the temporary naming of a result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
> 
> - **Benefits**: Enhances readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries, especially useful for breaking down complex joins and subqueries.

> [!important]- **Pivoting Data**
> 
> Pivoting transforms data from rows into columns, turning unique values from one column into multiple columns in the output, facilitating easier comparative analysis.
> 
> - **SQL Tools**: Utilizes `PIVOT` in SQL Server or conditional aggregation in other RDBMS like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

> [!important]- **Dynamic SQL**
> 
> Dynamic SQL involves SQL commands that are dynamically constructed at runtime and executed as strings. This allows for more flexible and programmable interactions with the database.
> 
> - **Use Cases**: Building queries programmatically based on varying user inputs or application conditions.

> [!important]- **Advanced Joins**
> 
> Beyond basic inner and outer joins, advanced joins include self joins, cross joins, and natural joins which are used to handle specific types of data relationships and query requirements.
> 
> - **Complexity Handling**: Useful in scenarios requiring sophisticated data linkage such as combining data from a table with itself (self-join) or cartesian products (cross join).

> [!important]- **Set Operations**
> 
> Set operations extend the ability to perform mathematical set operations like unions, intersections, and differences directly with result sets.
> 
> - **Operations**: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`, each serving to combine or contrast data from multiple queries.

> [!important]- **Windowing**
> 
> Windowing pertains to the ability of window functions to operate on a set of rows with a flexible range related to the current row, which is great for running totals or moving averages.
> 
> - **Capabilities**: Defining windows or frames of data for calculations can be adjusted dynamically over a specified range.

> [!important]- **Geospatial Functions**
> 
> SQL databases equipped with geospatial capabilities allow for the manipulation and query of geographic data within SQL.
> 
> - **Functionalities**: Functions like `ST_Contains`, `ST_Distance`, and others in PostGIS (PostgreSQL) or spatial functions in MySQL help in processing geospatial information.

> [!important]- **Analytic Functions**
> 
> Analytic functions process data over a group of rows and return a single result for each row. These are akin to aggregate functions but more powerful due to their ability to respect row order and partitioning without collapsing rows.
> 
> - **Examples**: `LEAD`, `LAG`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`.
