# CAP Theorem

![[../Files/Images/Pasted image 20240501164239.png]]

## Overview

The CAP theorem states that aÂ distributed systemÂ can only provide two of three properties simultaneously:Â **consistency**,Â **availability**, andÂ **partition tolerance**. The theorem formalizes the tradeoff between consistency and availability when thereâ€™s a partition.


> [!important] Key Concepts
> - **Consistency**
> 	In a consistent system, allÂ **nodes see the same data simultaneously**. If we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation. The read should cause all nodes to return the same data. All users see the same data at the same time, regardless of the node they connect to. When data is written to a single node, it is then replicated across the other nodes in the system.
> 
> - **Availability**
>	When availability is present in a distributed system, it means that theÂ **system remains operational all of the time**. Every request will get a response regardless of the individual state of the nodes. This means that the system will operate even if there are multiple nodes down. Unlike a consistent system, thereâ€™sÂ **no guarantee that the response will be the most recent write operation**.
>
> - **Partition** tolerance
>	When a distributed system encounters a partition, it means that thereâ€™s aÂ **break in communication between nodes**. If a system is partition-tolerant, the system does not fail, regardless of whether messages are dropped or delayed between nodes within the system. To have partition tolerance, the system must replicate records across combinations of nodes and networks.

>The distributed system acts as a plain register with the value of variableÂ _X_. Thereâ€™s a network failure that results in a network partition between the two nodes in the system. An end-user performs a write request, and then a read request. Letâ€™s examine a case where a different node of the system processes each request. In this case, our system has two options:
>- It can fail at one of the requests, breaking the systemâ€™sÂ _availability_
>- It can execute both requests, returning a stale value from the read request and breaking the systemâ€™sÂ _consistency_
>The system canâ€™t process both requests successfully while also ensuring that the read returns the latest value written by the write. This is because the results of the write operation canâ€™t be propagated from node A to node B because of the network partition.

## CAP theorem NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases are great for distributed networks. They allow forÂ **horizontal scaling**, and they can quickly scale across multiple nodes. When deciding which NoSQL database to use, itâ€™s important to keep the CAP theorem in mind. NoSQL databases can be classified based on the two CAP features they support:

> [!NOTE]- CA databases
> 	CA databases enable consistency and availability across all nodes. Unfortunately, CA databasesÂ **canâ€™t deliver fault tolerance**. In any distributed system, partitions are bound to happen, which means this type of database isnâ€™t a very practical choice. That being said, you still can find a CA database if you need one. SomeÂ [[Relational Databases]], such asÂ PostgreSQL, allow for consistency and availability. You can deploy them to nodes using replication.


> [!NOTE]- CP databases
>	CP databases enable consistency and partition tolerance, but not availability. When a partition occurs, the system has toÂ **turn off inconsistent nodes until the partition can be fixed**.Â MongoDB is an example of a CP database. Itâ€™s a NoSQL database management system (DBMS) that uses documents for data storage. Itâ€™s considered schema-less, which means that it doesnâ€™t require a defined database schema. Itâ€™s commonly used inÂ big dataÂ and applications running in different locations. The CP system is structured so that thereâ€™s only one primary node that receives all of the write requests in a given replica set. Secondary nodes replicate the data in the primary nodes, so if the primary node fails, a secondary node can stand-in.


> [!NOTE]- AP databases
>	AP databases enable availability and partition tolerance, but not consistency. In the event of a partition, all nodes are available, but theyâ€™re not all updated. For example, if a user tries to access data from a bad node, theyÂ **wonâ€™t receive the most up-to-date version of the data**. When the partition is eventually resolved, most AP databases will sync the nodes to ensure consistency across them. Apache Cassandra is an example of an AP database. Itâ€™s a NoSQL database with no primary node, meaning that all of the nodes remain available. Cassandra allows for eventual consistency because users can resync their data right after a partition is resolved.
