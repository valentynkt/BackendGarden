# OpenID Connect
## Overview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows applications to verify user identities based on the authentication performed by an **Identity Provider (IdP)** and obtain basic profile information. While OAuth 2.0 focuses on authorizing access to resources, OIDC specifically manages user authentication, enabling a unified identity for accessing multiple applications, commonly known as **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

## Key Concepts

OpenID Connect brings additional components to OAuth 2.0, enhancing its capabilities for secure and user-friendly authentication.

> [!summary] **Core Components of OpenID Connect**
> 
> - **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authenticates users and issues ID tokens.
> - **Client (Relying Party)**: The application that uses OIDC to verify a userâ€™s identity.
> - **ID Token**: A token in JSON Web Token (JWT) format containing claims about the user, like name and email.
> - **UserInfo Endpoint**: An optional endpoint that provides additional user information.

---

## OIDC Flow

OIDC works by adding authentication capabilities to OAuth 2.0â€™s authorization flow. Hereâ€™s an outline of the process:

1. **User Requests Login**: The user requests access to the client application.
2. **Authorization Request**: The client sends a request to the IdPâ€™s authorization endpoint.
3. **User Authentication**: If the user isnâ€™t already authenticated, the IdP prompts the user to log in.
4. **Authorization Response**: The IdP returns an authorization code to the client.
5. **Token Request**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an **ID token** and optionally an access token at the token endpoint.
6. **Token Validation**: The client validates the ID token, verifying the userâ€™s identity.
7. **UserInfo Request** (Optional): The client can fetch additional profile information from the UserInfo endpoint if needed.

This process provides the client with an authenticated session and allows it to retrieve essential user information securely.

## ID Token Structure

The **ID token** is at the heart of OIDC, serving as proof of authentication. It contains claims about the user and the authentication event:

> [!important] **Core Claims in the ID Token**
> 
> - **sub**: Unique identifier for the user.
> - **name**: Userâ€™s full name.
> - **email**: Userâ€™s email address.
> - **aud**: Intended audience, usually the client ID.
> - **iss**: Issuer identifier, indicating the IdP that issued the token.
> - **iat** and **exp**: Timestamps for when the token was issued and when it expires.
> - **nonce**: A unique string used to prevent replay attacks.

The ID token is typically encoded as a JWT, signed by the IdPâ€™s private key, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

## OpenID Connect Scopes and Claims

OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 scopes to allow fine-grained access to user information. Some standard OIDC scopes include:

> [!summary] **Key OIDC Scopes**
> 
> - **openid**: Required for OIDC; initiates ID token issuance.
> - **profile**: Access to basic profile information (e.g., name, birthdate).
> - **email**: Grants access to the userâ€™s email address.
> - **address**: Provides access to the userâ€™s physical address.
> - **phone**: Grants access to the userâ€™s phone number.

These scopes determine which claims are included in the ID token or accessible through the UserInfo endpoint.

## OIDC Flows

OIDC supports multiple flows to accommodate different application types and security needs. The following flows are available:

> [!info] **OIDC Authorization Flows**
> 
> - **Authorization Code Flow**: Recommended for server-side applications, offering high security by exchanging an authorization code for tokens.
> - **Implicit Flow**: Suitable for Single Page Applications (SPAs) but generally discouraged for high-security apps due to limitations on token handling.
> - **Hybrid Flow**: A mix of authorization code and implicit flows, enabling clients to receive tokens both directly and through code exchanges.
> - **Client Credentials Flow** (OAuth only): A flow for machine-to-machine authentication, not generally used for user identity verification in OIDC.

For detailed examples of each flow, refer to [[OAuth 2.0 Flows]].

## OIDC Best Practices

OIDC has specific best practices for ensuring secure and reliable authentication.

> [!important] Best Practices
> 
> - **Use Authorization Code Flow**: For most applications, this flow offers the best balance of security and user experience.
> - **Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short-lived ID tokens to reduce the risk of token misuse.
> - **Validate the ID Token**: Check claims such as `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) to ensure the token is intended for your application.
> - **Nonce for Replay Protection**: Use the `nonce` parameter to mitigate replay attacks.
> - **Secure Storage of Refresh Tokens**: If refresh tokens are used, store them securely (e.g., in a secure HTTP-only cookie).

## OIDC vs OAuth 2.0

While both OAuth 2.0 and OIDC work with tokens and share a similar workflow, their purposes are distinct:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Focuses on authorization, allowing applications to access resources on behalf of a user.
- **OpenID Connect**: Focuses on authentication, enabling applications to verify user identity.

Using OAuth 2.0 with OIDC allows applications to benefit from both secure authorization and user verification, a common setup for applications needing single sign-on (SSO) and data access from external providers.

## Summary

OpenID Connect (OIDC) extends OAuth 2.0 by adding an authentication layer, enabling secure, standardized user identity verification across multiple applications. By leveraging OAuth 2.0â€™s token-based flow, OIDC facilitates Single Sign-On (SSO) while ensuring user information is secure and authenticated. Integrating OIDC into applications provides an effective solution for both authorization and identity management in modern web applications.
