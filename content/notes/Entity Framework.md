# Entity Framework

## Code-First with [[Entity Framework]] in .NET

Entity Framework (EF) is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for [[BackendGarden/content/notes/NET|.NET]] developers that fully supports the Code-First approach. Using EF, developers can define their database schema through C# classes, and EF handles all the database operations based on the defined models.

### How Entity Framework Supports Code-First

Entity Framework simplifies the Code-First approach by automating the database schema creation and update processes based on the domain models defined in code:

> [!example]-
> - **Database Schema Generation**: EF can generate the database schema directly from the domain models (C# classes). This includes tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes.
> - **Migrations**: EF includes a powerful migration toolset that allows developers to version their database schema changes and apply them systematically.
> - **Seeding Data**: EF allows for easy data seeding, which can be used to populate the database with initial data during development.
