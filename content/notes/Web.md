## Overview

"Web Fundamentals" provides an in-depth look at the essential technologies and protocols that form the backbone of the internet and web applications. This topic serves as a comprehensive introduction to the architecture and core components that facilitate web communication and functionality.

> [!summary]- Introduction to the Web
> 
> The web, a pivotal innovation in global communication, operates on a network of computers connected via the internet. It enables the seamless exchange of information through web applications that users interact with daily. At its core, the web uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to facilitate communications, which are structured around the client-server model.
> 
> Web applications are dynamic platforms that deliver content and services to users. They run on web browsers and interact with web servers to fetch data, often using a mix of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive experiences. Each web application operates within the framework of the client-server architecture, where the client (the user's device) sends requests to a server that processes them and returns the requested content or data.
> 
> For a more detailed understanding of how these interactions are structured, see [[Client-Server Architecture Pattern]].
> 
> This structure not only simplifies the interaction between disparate computing devices but also underpins the functionality of the internet, allowing for scalable, distributed, and flexible communication pathways. This connectivity is essential for the vast array of online activities, from simple browsing and shopping to complex cloud-based applications and services


> [!summary]- Connection to [[OSI model]]
> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model provides a layered framework that explains the different stages data goes through from physical transmission to application processing on the web. This structured approach helps clarify how various networking technologies interact to deliver web services. For an in-depth look at each layer's role in web communications, see [[OSI model]].


> [!summary]- Web Communication Protocols
> - **HTTP and Its Evolutions** ([[HTTP]], [[HTTP 2]], [[HTTP 3]]): Covers the evolution of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and its importance in web data exchange.
> - **Transmission Protocols** ([[TCP vs UDP]]): Discusses the roles of Transmission Control Protocol ([[TCP]]) and User Datagram Protocol ([[UDP]]) in managing data transmission over the internet.
> - **Additional Protocols**: Insights into other critical protocols like [[Domain Name System|Domain Name System (DNS)]] for domain name resolution, [[SSL and TLS Protocols]] for secure data transmission, and [[WebSocket]]  for enabling real-time communication.


> [!summary]- Data Handling and Formats
> - **Data Formats** ([[XML]], JSON): Examines XML and JSON, two predominant formats used for structuring data in web communications.
> - **MIME Types** ([[MIME Types]]): Describes MIME types and their role in specifying the format of files transmitted over the internet.


> [!summary]- Security and Performance Enhancements
> 
> - **Secure Communications** ([[SSL and TLS Protocols]]): Explains how encryption protocols like SSL/TLS protect data integrity and confidentiality.
> - **IP Technology** ([[IPv4 vs IPv6]]): Details the functionalities and improvements brought by IPv6 over IPv4 in handling internet addresses.
> - **Content Delivery** ([[Content Delivery Networks|Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)]]): Discusses how CDNs optimize the delivery of web content to improve speed and reduce latency.


> [!summary]- Session Management
> - **Cookies and Session Management** ([[Cookies and Sessions]]): Overview of how web applications maintain user state and session information using cookies and other session management techniques.
