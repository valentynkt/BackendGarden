## Overview

"Web Fundamentals" provides an in-depth look at the essential technologies and protocols that form the backbone of the internet and web applications. This topic serves as a comprehensive introduction to the architecture and core components that facilitate web communication and functionality.

> [!summary]- Introduction to the Web
> 
> The web, a pivotal innovation in global communication, operates on a network of computers connected via the internet. It enables the seamless exchange of information through web applications that users interact with daily. At its core, the web uses [[HTTP]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to facilitate communications, which are structured around the client-server model.
> 
> Web applications are dynamic platforms that deliver content and services to users. They run on web browsers and interact with web servers to fetch data, often using a mix of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive experiences. Each web application operates within the framework of the client-server architecture, where the client (the user's device) sends requests to a server that processes them and returns the requested content or data.
> 
> For a more detailed understanding of how these interactions are structured, see [[Client-Server Architecture Pattern]].
> 
> This structure not only simplifies the interaction between disparate computing devices but also underpins the functionality of the internet, allowing for scalable, distributed, and flexible communication pathways. This connectivity is essential for the vast array of online activities, from simple browsing and shopping to complex cloud-based applications and services


> [!summary]- Connection to [[OSI model]]
> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model provides a layered framework that explains the different stages data goes through from physical transmission to application processing on the web. This structured approach helps clarify how various networking technologies interact to deliver web services. For an in-depth look at each layer's role in web communications, see [[OSI model]].
