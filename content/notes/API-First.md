## Intro
The API-first approach prioritizes APIs at the beginning of the software development process, positioning APIs as the building blocks of software. API-first organizations develop APIs before writing other code, instead of treating them as afterthoughts. This lets teams construct applications with internal and external services that are delivered through APIs.

---
For an organization to adopt an API-first development model, they need to prioritize APIs, recognize the role of public, private, and partner APIs in organizations, and understand the [API lifecycle](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-lifecycle/) and the tooling needed to become API-first.

The most farsighted companies take an API-first approach to their software development. Before writing a single line of code, developers, in partnership with the business, first design or build the API. This ensures the underlying app can seamlessly connect with internal and external applications. Doing so expands the app's capabilities and makes it accessible to partners and end-users.

APIs are not one-and-done projects. APIs are key building blocks that need to be maintained and improved. Companies are recognizing this and building teams to support it.

## Steps to implement API-first
1. Define which type of API you are going to use ([[API#Types of APIs]])
2. API lifecycle

	Having a shared understanding of what the API lifecycle is across your organization, and possessing a common vocabulary for describing it, will help your teams get on the same page when developing APIs with greater productivity, quality, and governance needed to drive your enterprise.


## API-first rules

An API-first strategy aims to help companies leverage API building blocks to more easily create solutions or products, save time and money, and ultimately generate more value. How can the design of those APIs contribute to this goal? To be an API-first design, an API’s interface contract should have the following traits:

``` ad-important
- Alignment with an organization’s goals
- Reusability
- Interoperability
- The ability to evolve
- User-friendliness
- Security
- Efficiency
- Pragmatism
```
