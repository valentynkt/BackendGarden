## Overview

SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol standard for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It relies on [[XML]] (Extensible Markup Language) for its message format and usually relies on other application layer protocols, most notably [[HTTP]] or [[SMTP]], for message negotiation and transmission.

## Characteristics of SOAP

SOAP defines a set of rules for structuring messages that can be processed by any operating system. SOAP [[API]]s are highly standardized and provide robust mechanisms for ensuring that messages are delivered correctly and securely.

> [!info]-
> - **Protocol**: SOAP can operate over any transport protocol such as [[HTTP]], [[SMTP]], [[TCP]], or JMS.
> - **Enveloping**: SOAP messages are encapsulated in an envelope. They can contain a header (optional) and a body, which is the main part of the message.
> - **Encoding Rules**: Defines a serialization mechanism that can be used to exchange instances of application-defined datatypes.
> - **Convention**: Uses a specific convention for representing procedure calls and responses.


## Pros/Cons

SOAP APIs are well-suited for complex enterprise applications due to their strict standards and robust security:

> [!success]- Pros
> - **Standardization**: SOAP ensures strict compliance with standards, making it suitable for formal enterprise environments.
> - **Security**: Features comprehensive security protocols like WS-Security for authentication, authorization, and encryption.
> - **[[Extensibility]]**: Can be extended with protocols such as WS-ReliableMessaging for enhanced capabilities.
> - **Stateful Operations**: Supports operations that require the server to maintain client session state.
> - **Language and Platform Independence**: Uses [[XML]], allowing use across different platforms and programming languages.
> - **[[ACID Properties|ACID]] Compliance**: Facilitates reliable transaction processing by supporting ACID-compliant transactions.

However, SOAP also presents several challenges that may affect its suitability for some projects:

> [!warning]- Cons
> - **Complexity**: The complexity of SOAP can be daunting for new developers due to its detailed standards and features.
> - **Performance Overhead**: SOAP's use of [[XML]] can increase message size and reduce performance relative to simpler protocols like [[REST]].
> - **Limited Flexibility**: The strict standards can restrict how data is handled and result in verbose messages.
> - **Steep Learning Curve**: Learning SOAPâ€™s various standards and protocols requires significant time and effort.
> - **Browser Compatibility**: Setting up SOAP calls is more complex than using [[REST API|REST]], which can be easily managed in modern web browsers.


## Common Use Cases

SOAP is widely used in enterprise environments and integrated large-scale systems:

> [!example]-
> - **Financial Services**: Banks and other financial institutions use SOAP for secure and reliable communication of transactional data.
> - **Telecommunications**: Used for billing services and customer relationship management.
> - **Health Care**: Exchanges patient information, billing data, and scheduling between facilities.

## Conclusion

SOAP APIs are particularly well-suited for business-critical applications requiring high security, transactional reliability, and standardized operations across different networks and domains. While SOAP can be more complex and resource-intensive than other approaches, its robustness makes it ideal for certain use cases in enterprise environments.
