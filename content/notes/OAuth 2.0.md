# OAuth 2.0

![[Pasted image 20231019204643.png]]

## Overview

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access a userâ€™s resources without sharing user credentials. It provides a token-based authorization process, allowing users to grant applications access to specific data securely and efficiently.

---

## Core Components of OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 involves four main roles, each critical to the authorization workflow:

> [!summary]
> - **Resource Owner (User)**: The individual granting access to their data.
> - **Client (Application)**: The third-party application requesting access to the userâ€™s data.
> - **Authorization Server**: Issues and manages tokens, facilitating access requests.
> - **Resource Server**: Hosts the protected resources and verifies access using the provided tokens.

## OAuth 2.0 Workflow

OAuth 2.0 enables the resource owner to grant access to their data without directly sharing credentials. This involves:

1. **Authorization Request**: The client requests authorization from the user.
2. **Authorization Grant**: If approved, the client receives an authorization grant.
3. **Token Request**: The client exchanges the authorization grant for an access token from the authorization server.
4. **Access Resource**: The client uses the access token to access the protected resources on the resource server.

### Tokens in OAuth 2.0

- **Access Token**: A short-lived token enabling access to protected resources.
- **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens when they expire.
- **Token Format**: Most commonly, access tokens are [[JSON Web Tokens|JWT]]s, securely storing claims and permissions.

## Real-World Example

Consider signing up for Stack Overflow using a Google account:

> [!info] Real-World Scenario
> - **Resource Owner**: The user registering on Stack Overflow.
> - **Client**: Stack Overflow as the third-party app requesting access.
> - **Authorization Server**: Google, verifying the user and issuing an access token.
> - **Resource Server**: Google servers storing the userâ€™s data.

In this example, Google issues an access token to Stack Overflow, allowing it to access basic user profile data without direct access to the user's credentials.

## OAuth 2.0 Flows

OAuth 2.0 offers multiple flows for different application needs:

> [!summary] 
> 
> - **Authorization Code Flow**: Secure flow for server-side applications, using an authorization code to exchange for an access token.
> - **Implicit Flow**: Simplified flow for single-page applications where tokens are returned directly.
> - **Client Credentials Flow**: Used for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication.
> - **Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow**: Suitable for legacy systems, where users provide credentials directly to the client.

## Best Practices for OAuth 2.0

Following best practices can improve the security and efficiency of OAuth 2.0 implementations:

> [!important] Best Practices
> 
> - **Use Short-Lived Access Tokens**: Limit the lifespan to reduce security risks; provide refresh tokens if necessary.
> - **Limit Token Scope**: Ensure tokens have only the minimum permissions required.
> - **Secure Token Storage**: Store tokens in headers, avoid storing them in cookies or URLs.
> - **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect against DoS attacks with rate limiting on token issuance.
> - **Token Revocation**: Allow users to revoke access to their data.

## OAuth 2.0 and [[OpenID Connect]] Integration

OAuth 2.0 focuses on resource authorization, while **OpenID Connect** (OIDC) adds a layer of user authentication. OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0, allowing applications to authenticate users and retrieve basic profile information.

> [!summary]
> 
> - **OAuth 2.0**: Manages authorization and data sharing between applications.
> - **OpenID Connect**: Adds authentication capabilities, enabling user identity verification through OAuth 2.0.

Using both protocols, applications benefit from secure, streamlined authentication and authorization, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications.

### Advantages of Using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect

> [!success] Key Benefits
> - **Enhanced Security**: Combines authorization with identity verification.
> - **SSO Capabilities**: Simplifies login across multiple apps with one authentication process.
> - **Streamlined User Experience**: Reduces login prompts, improving usability.

## Summary

OAuth 2.0 is a robust authorization framework that enables secure data sharing between applications while protecting user credentials. When paired with OpenID Connect, it provides complete user identity verification, facilitating Single Sign-On and ensuring a seamless, secure experience.
