# Taking notes

![[Pasted image 20240502164045.png]]

## **Overview**  

Effective note-taking is essential for enhancing learning and memory retention. Initially, mastering this skill was challenging for me. Through persistence and experimentation with different methods, I've developed a reliable note-taking system that has transformed my learning experience. This has prompted me to share the insights and tools that have been instrumental in refining my approach.

## **Personal Experience**  

When I first started taking notes, it was quite tough. I love learning new things, but I kept forgetting details even after revisiting topics multiple times. This frustration led me to try various note-taking strategies and tools. After much trial and error, I refined my approach and now have nearly 500 detailed notes on backend topics, each organized with examples, tips, and warnings. This collection has become a vital resource, almost like a second brain, greatly enhancing my ability to quickly retrieve and use information. This structured approach has made learning more effective and rewarding


## **Why Take Notes?**

Our brains generate a plethora of ideas daily, and while we might remember many, there are always details that slip through the cracks. Remember, 
"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." (David Allen)  This concept underscores the importance of note-taking. Imagine learning without taking notes as a linear function: straightforward at the beginning but increasingly overwhelming as new information accumulates. In contrast, note-taking is similar to a logarithmic functionâ€”it demands substantial effort initially but becomes progressively more valuable over time. This early investment in organizing and retaining information matures into a comprehensive and navigable knowledge base, turning your notes into an invaluable asset for continuous learning.

## **Methods and Tools for Effective Note-Taking**

Taking notes is a personalized process, and there's no one-size-fits-all method, but I'd like to share my approach which combines elements of Zettelkasten, Second Brain, and Digital Garden philosophies. This hybrid method leverages the strengths of each system to optimize learning and information retention.

### Zettelkasten Method

Zettelkasten moves away from traditional hierarchical folder structures. Instead, it uses a single repository for all notes which are interconnected through links, creating a dynamic web of information similar to a brain's neural network. This method enhances the integration of knowledge and allows for complex information relationships and easier navigation as the volume of notes increases. Here are some key practices:

- **Single Repository**: All notes reside in one place and are interconnected.
- **Map of Contents (MoC)**: Instead of using tags, related notes are linked to a 'Map of Contents' which acts as a central hub for topics.
- **Metadata Use**: Each note includes metadata such as creation date and aliases to simplify searching and organizing.
- **No Tags for General Topics**: General categorization is managed through MoCs rather than tags, focusing on thematic connections rather than rigid classifications.

**Tags Types**
- **Purpose Tags**:
    - **#LearningIT**: Tags notes intended for public sharing and educational purposes of IT.
    - **#Productivity**: Public notes for education purposes about NonTech topics
    - **#Personal**: Tags for private reflections and daily entries which are not meant for public viewing.
- **Stage Tags**: seed, bud, evergreen

> Zettelkasten is more similar to [[Composition relationships]]
> Remember! [[Favor Composition Over Inheritance]]

### [[Digital Garden]]

My Digital Garden is not only a personal knowledge base but also a public learning platform. It embodies the philosophy of growing ideas over time:

- **Regular Review**: Topics are revisited and updated to keep the content fresh and relevant.
- **Public Learning**: Notes are shared on my website, inviting community feedback and interaction, which enriches the learning process.
- **Growth Stages**: Notes are categorized by maturityâ€”seed, bud, evergreenâ€”indicating the development stage of the ideas they contain.
