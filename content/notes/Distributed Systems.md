# Distributed Systems

## Overview

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system. These systems work together to achieve a common goal and are connected by a network. Distributed systems are designed to share resources, data, and tasks across multiple nodes, enhancing scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Key Concepts

Distributed systems encompass several fundamental concepts that enable their functionality and efficiency:

> [!important]
> 
> - **Transparency**: The system should hide the complexity of distribution from users and applications, making it appear as a single system.
> - **[[Scalability|Scalability]]**: The ability to handle increased load by adding more nodes to the system.
> - **[[Fault Tolerance]]**: The system's ability to continue functioning even if some components fail.
> - **Concurrency**: Multiple components can process tasks simultaneously, improving performance.
> - **Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across distributed components, often achieved through consensus algorithms and data replication.

## Components

Distributed systems consist of several key components that interact to provide a unified service:

> - **Nodes**: Independent computers that work together as part of the distributed system.
> - **Network**: The communication infrastructure connecting the nodes.
> - **Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities, such as messaging, data storage, and security.
> - **Services**: Applications or functionalities provided by the distributed system.

## Types of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems can be categorized based on their architecture and the way they manage tasks and data:

> - **[[Client-Server Architecture Pattern|Client-Server]] Systems**: Clients request services from servers, which process the requests and return responses.
> - **[[Peer-to-Peer Architecture Pattern|Peer-to-Peer]] Systems**: Each node can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources and tasks without a central coordinator.
> - **[[Cloud Network]] Computing**: Provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet, often involving distributed data centers.
> - **Cluster Computing**: A group of tightly-coupled computers working together, often used for high-performance computing tasks.

## Key Principles

Several principles guide the design and implementation of distributed systems:

> - **Scalability**: The system should efficiently handle growth in the number of nodes or workload.
> - **Fault Tolerance**: The system should continue to operate correctly even in the presence of faults.
> - **Consistency**: The system should ensure that all nodes see the same data at the same time.
> - **Security**: The system should protect data and resources from unauthorized access and tampering.

## Use Cases

Distributed systems are used in various applications where scalability, reliability, and performance are crucial:

> - **Big Data Processing**: Systems like Hadoop and Spark for processing large datasets.
> - **[[Content Delivery Networks|Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)]]**: Distributing content to users globally for faster access.
> - **[[Internet Of Things|IoT Systems]]**: Managing and processing data from numerous interconnected devices.
> - **Financial Services**: Ensuring high availability and consistency for transactions and data.

## Pros/Cons
