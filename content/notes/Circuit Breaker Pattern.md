# Circuit Breaker
## Diagram

![[What-is-Circuit-Breaker-Pattern-in-Microservices.webp]]

## Overview

The Circuit Breaker pattern is an essential resilience mechanism in a [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|microservices]] architecture that prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. This pattern acts as a safeguard, halting the flow of requests to a service when failures reach a certain threshold, thus ensuring system stability and preventing further damage.

> [!abstract] 
> The Circuit Breaker pattern functions like an electrical circuit breaker in software design, isolating problem spots in the system to prevent failures from cascading and allowing recovery and maintenance without halting the entire system.

## Key Concepts

![[../Files/Images/Circuit-Breaker-Pattern 1.webp]]

Implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern involves several core concepts that enhance the robustness of microservice interactions:

> [!important]
> 
> - **State Management**: The circuit breaker manages three states:
>     - **Closed**: Requests flow freely.
>     - **Open**: Requests are blocked to prevent further failures.
>     - **Half-Open**: Some requests are allowed to test if the issue is resolved.
> - **Failure Threshold**: Determines when the circuit should 'trip' and switch from Closed to Open, based on predefined criteria such as the number of failures over a time window.
> - **Timeouts and Cooldowns**: When open, the circuit breaker stops all requests for a set period allowing the affected service time to recover before retrying.
> - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides alternative solutions or responses when requests fail, enhancing user experience despite operational issues.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern requires integrating it with the service invocation pathway in a microservices environment. Here are general guidelines:

> [!summary] **Implementation Steps**
> 
> - **Integration with Client Libraries**: Most service calls should be wrapped with a circuit breaker functionality, which can be achieved using libraries or frameworks designed for this purpose, such as Hystrix or Resilience4j.
> - **Monitoring and Alerts**: Monitor the status and metrics of your circuit breakers to respond to issues proactively. Implementing alerts for state changes in circuit breakers can aid in quick troubleshooting and recovery.
> - **Testing and Calibration**: Regularly test the circuit breaker logic under various failure scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected. Calibration of thresholds and timeouts based on real-world usage patterns is crucial for effective protection.

## Additional Considerations

> [!info]-
> **Service Degradation and Recovery**: Implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern should also involve planning for service degradation and graceful recovery strategies. This includes designing fallback mechanisms and ensuring that partial functionality can still be provided when a circuit breaker is tripped.
> 
> **Granularity of Circuit Breakers**: Determine the appropriate granularity for circuit breakersâ€”whether they should be applied at the service level, endpoint level, or method level. This decision impacts how isolated failures are contained and managed.
> 
> **Circuit Breaker State Transition Handling**: Ensure proper handling of state transitions, especially from Half-Open to Closed or Open states. Implementing exponential backoff strategies for retry attempts can help in managing load during recovery periods.
## Summary

> [!summary] 
> The Circuit Breaker pattern is a crucial defensive design technique in the microservices architecture that prevents failures in one part of the system from bringing down the entire system. By effectively managing service interruptions, it enables systems to be more resilient and reliable, providing a safer user experience in the face of unexpected failures.
