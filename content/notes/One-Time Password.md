## Overview

A One-Time Password (OTP) is a unique, temporary code that is used for a single [[Authentication]] session or transaction. OTPS are an effective way to enhance security by mitigating the risks associated with static passwords. They are widely used in two-factor authentication (2FA) and [[Multi-Factor Authentication]] (MFA) systems.

## How OTP Works

1. **Generation**: An OTP is generated using an algorithm that ensures the code is unique and valid for only a short period or a single use.
2. **Delivery**: The OTP is delivered to the user via a predefined method, such as SMS, email, or a dedicated authentication app.
3. **Usage**: The user enters the OTP as part of the authentication process. The server verifies the OTP against the expected value.
4. **Validation**: If the OTP matches the expected value, the user is authenticated. The OTP is then invalidated and cannot be used again.

## Types of OTP

> [!summary] Types of OTP
> 
> - **Time-Based OTP (TOTP)**: Generates a new password at fixed intervals, typically every 30 or 60 seconds. The password is valid only for the duration of the interval.
> - **Event-Based OTP (HOTP)**: Generates a new password based on a counter that increments with each new password request. The password is valid until it is used or a new one is generated.
> - **SMS OTP**: Delivered to the user via SMS. It is typically valid for a short period or until it is used.
> - **Email OTP**: Delivered to the user via email. It is similar to SMS OTP in terms of validity and usage.

## Use Cases

- **Online Banking**: Used for secure login and transaction verification.
- **E-commerce**: Ensures secure payments and account access.
- **Enterprise Security**: Protects access to corporate systems and sensitive data.
- **Password Reset**: Provides a secure method for resetting forgotten passwords.

## Pros/Cons

> [!success] Pros
> 
> - **Enhanced Security**: Provides an additional layer of security beyond static passwords.
> - **Ease of Use**: Simple for users to understand and implement.
> - **Dynamic Nature**: OTPS are unique and expire quickly, reducing the risk of interception and reuse.

> [!danger] Cons
> 
> - **Delivery Dependency**: Relies on the availability of the delivery method (e.g., SMS, email).
> - **Potential Delays**: OTP delivery can be delayed due to network issues, impacting user experience.
> - **Implementation Complexity**: Requires secure generation, delivery, and validation mechanisms.
