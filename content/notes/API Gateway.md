## Overview

In a [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] architecture, an API Gateway serves as a central entry point for clients to access various [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]]. It acts as a [[Facade Pattern|Facade]], providing a unified interface for clients to interact with the system. The API Gateway handles client requests, routing them to the appropriate [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]], and may also perform additional functionalities such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.

### Key Concepts

- **Routing**: The API Gateway routes incoming requests from clients to the appropriate [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] based on predefined rules or configurations.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: It authenticates clients and authorizes their access to specific [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] or resources, ensuring security and access control.
- **Rate Limiting**: The API Gateway may enforce rate limits on incoming requests to prevent abuse or overload of [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]].
- **Request/Response Transformation**: It can transform requests or responses to/from [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] to adapt them to client requirements or to maintain compatibility between [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] versions.


### Implementation Overview

Implementing an API Gateway involves integrating it into the [[Microservices Architecture Pattern|Microservices]] architecture and configuring it to handle client requests effectively. It requires defining routing rules, configuring security policies for authentication and authorization, setting up rate limiting mechanisms, and implementing request/response transformation logic. There are ready API Gateway solution that have implemented features.
