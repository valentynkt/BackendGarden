# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

![[../Files/Images/Pasted image 20240428160806.png]]
## Overview

Monolithic and microservices architectures represent two fundamentally different approaches to structuring applications. Monolithic architecture bundles all application processes into a single interconnected and interdependent unit, while microservices architecture breaks them down into smaller, independent services.
### Key Differences

| Aspect          | Monolithic                                          | Microservices                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment**  | Single executable; redeploy whole app for changes.  | Independently deployable services.             |
| **Scalability** | Scale entire app; can be resource-inefficient.      | Scale services independently as needed.        |
| **Development** | Single codebase; can slow down as size increases.   | Distributed dev teams; can increase agility.   |
| **Complexity**  | Complex internally; simpler communication and debug.| Simpler internally; complex service management.|
| **Data Management** | Single database; simpler but can bottleneck.   | Each service has its own database; complex integration.|
| **Failure Isolation** | Bugs can crash the whole system.              | Failures usually contained within services.    |
| **Technology Stack** | Typically one stack; less flexible.             | Different stacks for different services; more flexible.|


## Conclusion

Choosing between monolithic and microservices architectures depends on various factors, including team size, application complexity, scalability needs, and the organization's capability to manage distributed systems. Each architecture offers distinct benefits and challenges, making them suitable for different project requirements and organizational capabilities.
