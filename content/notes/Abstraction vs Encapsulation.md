# Abstraction vs Encapsulation

Lets take a look on difference between [[Abstraction]] vs [[Encapsulation]]

A lot of times programmers often confuse abstraction with encapsulation because in reality the two concepts are quite intertwined and share a relationship between them. Abstraction, as weâ€™ve seen pertains to hiding underlying details and implementation in a program. Encapsulation, on the other hand, describes how abstraction occurs in a program.

Abstraction is a design-level process but encapsulation is an implementation process. **Encapsulation tells us how exactly you can implement abstraction in the program**. Abstraction pertains to only displaying the essential details to the user whereas encapsulation pertains to typing up all the data members and associated member functions into a single abstracted unit.


| No  | Abstraction                                                                              | Encapsulation                                                                                                         |

| 1.  | It is the process of gaining information.                                                | It is a method that helps wrap up data into a single module.                                                          |
| 2.  | The problems in this technique are solved at the interface level.                        | Problems in encapsulation are solved at the implementation level.                                                     |
| 3.  | It helps hide the unwanted details/information.                                          | It helps hide data using a single entity, or using a unit with the help of method that helps protect the information. |
| 4.  | It can be implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.                             | It can be implemented using access modifiers like public, private and protected.                                      |
| 5.  | The complexities of the implementation are hidden using interface and abstract class.    | The data is hidden using methods such as getters and setters.                                                         |
| 6.  | Abstraction can be performed using objects that are encapsulated within a single module. | Objects in encapsulation don't need to be in abstraction.                                                             |
|     |                                                                                          |                                                                                                                       |

> The most significant difference between the two is that data abstraction is a method which helps to hide the unwanted data from the user, while data encapsulation is a method which helps to hide data using a single entity.
