# Push Notification Authentication

## Overview

Push Notification Authentication sends a verification prompt to the userâ€™s mobile device. This method leverages the userâ€™s device to securely and conveniently verify identity.

## How It Works

1. **User Login Request**: The user attempts to log in.
2. **Push Notification Sent**: The system sends a prompt to the userâ€™s mobile device.
3. **User Approval**: The user approves the request.
4. **Verification**: The system verifies approval and grants access.
