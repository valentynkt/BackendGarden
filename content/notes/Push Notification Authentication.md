# Push Notification Authentication

## Overview

Push Notification Authentication is a [[Passwordless Authentication]] method that uses push notifications sent to a user's registered mobile device to verify their identity. This method enhances security by leveraging the user's smartphone for authentication, ensuring that only the device owner can approve login requests.

## How Push Notification Authentication Works

1. **User Initiates Login**: The user attempts to log in to an application or service.
2. **Push Notification Sent**: The authentication server sends a push notification to the user's registered mobile device.
3. **User Approves Request**: The user receives the notification and approves or denies the login request.
4. **Authentication Verified**: If the user approves the request, the authentication server verifies the approval and grants access.

## Pros/Cons
