# Access Modifiers

Access modifiers specify the accessibility of an object and all of its members in the C# project. Moreover, all the C# types have access modifiers implemented, even if they are not stated (default access modifier is applied then).

Even though this topic is more related to the object-oriented concept, we will talk about it now, thus making it easier to understand the next article about methods, that strongly relies on access modifiers.

C# provides four types of access modifiers: private, public, protected, internal, and two combinations: protected-internal and private-protected.

``` ad-important
- [[#Private Access Modifier]]
- [[#Public Access Modifier]]
- [[#Protected Access Modifier]]
- [[#Internal Access Modifier]]
- [[#Protected Internal Access Modifier]]
- [[#Private Protected Access Modifier]]
```

## Private Access Modifier

Objects that implement **private** access modifiers are accessible only inside a class or a structure. As a result, we canâ€™t access them outside the class they are created:

``` csharp
class NumberClass
{
    private int number = 10;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        NumberClass num = new NumberClass();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // Error. We can't access the number variable because 
        // it has the private access modifier and its only accessible in the NumberClass class
    }
}
```

## Public Access Modifier

Objects that implement **public** access modifiers are accessible from everywhere in our project. Therefore, there are no accessibility restrictions:

``` csharp
class NumberClass
{
    public int number = 10;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        NumberClass num = new NumberClass();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // This is OK. The number variable has the public access modifier.
    }
}
```

## Protected Access Modifier

The **protected** keyword implies that the object is accessible inside the class and in all classes that derive from that class. 

``` csharp
class NumberClass
{
    protected int number = 10; //we can access this variable inside this class
}

class DerivedClass: NumberClass //this is inheritance. DerivedClass derives from the NumberClass class
{
    void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(number); //we can access it in this class as well because it derives from the NumberClass class
    }
}

class Program
{
    void Print()
    {
        NumberClass num = new NumberClass();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // Error. The number variable is inaccessible due to its protection level. 
                               // The Program class doesn't derive from the NumberClass
    }
}
```

## Internal Access Modifier

The **internal** keyword specifies that the object is accessible only inside its own assembly but not in other assemblies:

``` csharp
//First Project (ASSEMBLY)
public class NumberClassInFirstProject
{
    internal int number = 10; //we can access this variable inside this class
}

class ProgramInFirstProject
{
    void Print()
    {
        NumberClassInFirstProject num = new NumberClassInFirstProject();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // This is OK. Anywhere in this project (assembly) 
                                           // we can access the number variable.
    }
}

//Second project (ASSEMBLY)
class Program
{
    void Print()
    {
        NumberClassInFirstProject num = new NumberClassInFirstProject();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // Error. The number variable is inaccessible due to its protection level. 
                               //The Program class in second project can't access the internal members from another project
    }
}
```

## Protected Internal Access Modifier

The **protected** **internal** access modifier is a combination of protected and internal. As a result, we can access the protected internal member only in the same assembly or in a derived class in other assemblies (projects):

``` csharp
//First Project (ASSEMBLY)
public class NumberClassInFirstProject
{
    protected internal int number = 10; //we can access this variable inside this class
}

class ProgramInFirstProject
{
    void Print()
    {
        NumberClassInFirstProject num = new NumberClassInFirstProject();
        Console.WriteLine(num.number); // This is OK. Anywhere in this project (assembly) we can access the number variable.
    }
}

//Second project (ASSEMBLY)
class Program: NumberClassInFirstProject //Inheritance
{
    void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(number); //This is OK as well. The class Program derives from the NumberClassInFirstProject clas.
    }
}
```

## Private Protected Access Modifier

The **private protected** access modifier is a combination of private and protected keywords. We can access members inside the containing class or in a class that derives from a containing class, but only in the same assembly(project). Therefore, if we try to access it from another assembly, we will get an error.
