# Layered Architecture Pattern 

## Diagram

![[Pasted image 20240426152132.png]]

## Overview

The Layered Architecture Pattern organizes software into clear, hierarchical layers, each dedicated to a specific role within the application. Commonly used in various types of applicationsâ€”from enterprise systems to web applicationsâ€”this pattern simplifies development and improves system manageability and scalability.

### Key Concepts
The Layered Architecture Pattern embodies the principle of separation of concerns by structuring an application into layers that perform distinct functions with minimal overlap. It's important to note that while this pattern can include various layers, the specific layers and their responsibilities can differ based on the application's needs. The following are typical examples of layers in one common configuration:

>[!important]
>- **Presentation Layer (PL)**: Acts as the user interface, managing all user interactions, data presentation, and user input validation. It's the topmost layer that users interact with directly.
>- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Processes business rules, data validation, and task-specific behaviors. It serves as the core for decision-making and computation in the application.
>- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Also known as the Persistence Layer, it handles all data communication with databases or other storage systems, ensuring data is provided to the Business Logic Layer and saved appropriately.
>- **[[Database]] Layer (DBL)**: Specifically manages the storage, retrieval, update, and deletion of data in databases. This layer is crucial for data integrity and security.
>- **Service Layer (SL)**: (Optional) Provides a unified interface that facilitates communication between the Business Logic Layer and other parts of the application or external services. It simplifies interactions by aggregating business logic needs and data operations into cohesive services.

This pattern does not prescribe a specific set of layers; rather, it provides a framework that can be adapted based on the complexity and requirements of the application. For instance, the **[[Model-View-Controller Pattern]] (MVC)**  is an example of the Layered Architecture in software design, utilizing a three-layer approach that corresponds to Model (data), View (interface), and Controller (input logic), effectively demonstrating how this architectural pattern can be applied flexibly in different contexts.

### Implementation Overview

To successfully implement a Layered Architecture, developers should:

- **Ensure Layer Independence**: Design each layer to operate independently so that changes in one do not heavily impact others.
- **Standardize Communication**: Employ standardized interfaces or data transfer objects for interactions between layers to reduce dependency.
- **Support Flexible Deployment**: Construct layers to be deployable separately to enhance scalability and facilitate updates with minimal system downtime.

### Pros and Cons

Implementing a Layered Architecture comes with its set of advantages and disadvantages:

> [!success] Pros
> 
> - **Improved Organization**: Separating functionality into layers helps organize code better, making it easier to manage.
> - **Increased Flexibility**: Independent layers mean that changes in one layer require fewer changes in others, enhancing flexibility.
> - **Enhanced Maintainability**: It simplifies debugging and testing as each layer can be checked independently.

> [!Danger] Cons
> 
> - **Performance Overhead**: Each layer adds a potential delay as requests must pass through multiple layers before reaching their destination.
> - **Complexity in Dependencies**: Incorrectly implemented, layers can become tightly coupled, leading to a monolithic structure rather than a modular one.
> - **Over-Abstraction**: Too many layers can make the system overly complex and harder to understand.

### Best Use Cases

The Layered Architecture Pattern is best suited for:

- **Enterprise Applications**: Where different layers can [[Encapsulation|encapsulate]] various business models and processes.
- **Large-Scale Web Applications**: That require clear separation between the server-side logic and the client-side user interface.
- **Applications Requiring Clear Structure**: For easier maintenance, updates, and scalability without affecting the entire system.

## Summary

> [!summary] 
> The Layered Architecture Pattern organizes software into distinct layers such as Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access, each with specific roles. This structure enhances manageability and scalability, making it ideal for complex applications like enterprise and web systems. While it simplifies development by isolating code changes to specific layers, it can also increase complexity and introduce performance overhead if not implemented correctly.
