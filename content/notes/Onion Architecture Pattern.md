# Onion Architecture Pattern

## Diagram

## Overview

Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern that prioritizes the maintainability and flexibility of applications by structuring them into several concentric layers. This architecture is named for its resemblance to the layers of an onion, where the core domain logic is at the center, surrounded by layers that depend only on the layers beneath them.

## Key Components

> [!info]- **Core**:
>  At the very center, the Core layer contains the domain model, which represents the business and behavior objects. This layer is the heart of the application, where the business rules and domain logic reside.

> [!info]- **Domain Services**: 
> Surrounding the Core, this layer contains services that perform operations involving domain objects, encapsulating complex domain logic that doesnâ€™t naturally fit within a single entity.

> [!info]- **Application Services**: 
> This layer interacts with the Domain Services to perform tasks that fulfill the use cases of the application. It acts as a mediator between the domain and the external layers, directing tasks and ensuring the use of correct domain services.

> [!info]- **Infrastructure**: 
> The outermost layer, it interacts with external concerns and carries out tasks that should not pollute the inner layers, such as data access and communication with other infrastructure components.


## Pros/Cons

> [!success]- 
>  - **Decoupling**: The architecture promotes the separation of concerns by isolating the core logic from external influences and infrastructure dependencies.
> - **Flexibility**: Changes to external infrastructure, such as database or UI frameworks, have minimal impact on the core business logic.
> - **Testability**: The separation allows for easier testing, especially of the domain logic, which can be tested without external dependencies.


> [!danger]- 
> - **Complexity**: The layered structure and strict adherence to dependency rules can increase complexity, particularly in smaller projects where a simpler architecture might suffice.
> - **Initial Overhead**: Setting up an Onion Architecture can require more upfront work to define and implement the appropriate layers and dependencies correctly.


## Use Cases

>[!info]- **Best Use Cases for Onion Architecture**
>- **Enterprise Applications**: Ideal for large-scale enterprise systems where business rules change frequently and scalability is crucial.
>- **Complex Business Logic**: Beneficial for applications with complex business logic that requires clear separation from infrastructure and user interface concerns.
>- **Long-Term Projects**: Suitable for projects expected to evolve over time, needing a structure that accommodates growth and changes without significant rework.

## Difference from [[Layered Architecture Pattern]]

> [!important]- **Differences from N-Layer Architecture**
> 
> - **Dependency Direction**: Onion Architecture features dependencies that flow inward, with the domain model at the core and independent of external layers. In contrast, [[Layered Architecture Pattern|N-Layer Architecture]] often exhibits a top-down dependency where higher layers depend on lower layers.
> - **Data Flow Flexibility**: Onion Architecture encourages flexible interactions between layers through interfaces, permitting adaptability without impacting the core domain. N-Layer is typically more rigid, with structured and hierarchical layer interactions.
> - **Domain Centricity**: The domain-centric approach of Onion Architecture places the domain model at the very heart of the architecture, unlike N-Layer Architecture where the focus might be more distributed across layers.
