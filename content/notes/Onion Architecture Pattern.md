# Onion Architecture Pattern

## Diagram

## Overview

Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern designed to enhance maintainability and flexibility by structuring applications into several concentric layers. Named for its resemblance to an onion, this architecture places the core domain logic at the center, surrounded by layers that depend only on the layers beneath them.

## Key Components

> [!info] **Key Components**
> 
> - **Core**: Contains the domain model, representing the essential business and behavior objects. It is the heart of the application, where the core business rules and domain logic reside.
> - **Domain Services**: Surrounding the Core, this layer contains services that perform operations involving domain objects, encapsulating complex domain logic that doesnâ€™t naturally fit within a single entity.
> - **Application Services**: Interacts with Domain Services to fulfill the applicationâ€™s use cases. It acts as a mediator between the domain and external layers, ensuring the correct domain services are used for specific tasks.
> - **Infrastructure**: The outermost layer, responsible for interacting with external concerns, such as data access and communication with other infrastructure components. It carries out tasks that should not affect the inner layers.

## Pros and Cons

> [!success] **Pros**
> 
> - **Decoupling**: Promotes separation of concerns, isolating core logic from external influences and infrastructure dependencies.
> - **Flexibility**: Changes to external infrastructure, such as databases or UI frameworks, have minimal impact on the core business logic.
> - **Testability**: Easier testing of domain logic without external dependencies.

> [!danger] **Cons**
> 
> - **Complexity**: The layered structure and strict adherence to dependency rules can increase complexity, particularly in smaller projects where a simpler architecture might suffice.
> - **Initial Overhead**: Requires more upfront work to define and implement the appropriate layers and dependencies correctly.

## Use Cases

> [!info] **Best Use Cases for Onion Architecture**
> 
> - **Enterprise Applications**: Ideal for large-scale systems where business rules change frequently and scalability is crucial.
> - **Complex Business Logic**: Suitable for applications with complex business logic that requires clear separation from infrastructure and user interface concerns.
> - **Long-Term Projects**: Appropriate for projects expected to evolve over time, needing a structure that accommodates growth and changes without significant rework.

## Differences from N-Layer Architecture

> [!important] **Key Differences**
> 
> - **Dependency Direction**: Onion Architecture features dependencies that flow inward, with the domain model at the core and independent of external layers. In contrast, [[Layered Architecture Pattern|N-Layer Architecture]] often exhibits a top-down dependency where higher layers depend on lower layers.
> - **Data Flow Flexibility**: Onion Architecture encourages flexible interactions between layers through interfaces, permitting adaptability without impacting the core domain. N-Layer is typically more rigid, with structured and hierarchical layer interactions.
> - **Domain Centricity**: The domain-centric approach of Onion Architecture places the domain model at the very heart of the architecture, unlike N-Layer Architecture where the focus might be more distributed across layers.
