# Authorization
![[ced6562d-3be6-4dd4-a141-fed9e6b02182_1600x1226.webp]]

## Overview

Authorization is the process of determining the access rights and permissions granted to authenticated users or systems. Once a user's identity is verified, authorization defines what actions they are allowed to perform within an application or system, ensuring controlled access to resources based on user roles, policies, and privileges.

## Importance of Authorization

Authorization is critical for enforcing security policies, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions within their permitted scope.

> [!important]
> 
> - **Security**: Limits access to sensitive areas, reducing risks of data exposure.
> - **Resource Management**: Ensures users only interact with allowed resources.
> - **Operational Efficiency**: Automates access control based on roles, streamlining permissions.
> - **Compliance**: Helps organizations adhere to regulatory standards by controlling access.

## Authorization Methods

Authorization methods vary based on access needs, ranging from simple role-based models to more dynamic and contextual approaches.

> [!summary]
> 
> - **[[Role-Based Access Control]] (RBAC)**: Grants permissions based on user roles.
>     - Assigns users to predefined roles with specific access rights (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
> - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Uses policies based on user attributes.
>     - Factors like department, location, or job title determine access.
> - **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**: Centralized policies define access based on roles and conditions.
>     - Allows for dynamic permissions according to organizational policies.
> - **Rule-Based Access Control**: Sets rules for access based on conditions.
>     - Commonly used for time-based or location-based restrictions.
> - **Context-Aware Access Control**: Adapts permissions based on real-time context.
>     - Adjusts access based on factors like device security and user behavior.

## How Authorization Works

> [!info] **Authorization Process**
> 
> 1. **User Authentication**: Verify the user's identity.
> 2. **Access Request Evaluation**: System evaluates the user's role and permissions.
> 3. **Policy Check**: Checks against set rules or policies for the requested action.
> 4. **Access Granted or Denied**: User is allowed or restricted based on the evaluation.
> 5. **Continuous Enforcement**: Monitors compliance with access policies during the session.

## Best Practices for Authorization

Following best practices for authorization enhances security and ensures that access permissions are managed effectively.

> [!important] **Best Practices**
> 
> - **Enforce Least Privilege**: Assign only necessary permissions to minimize risk.
> - **Use Role-Based Access Control**: Simplifies permission management by grouping access rights.
> - **Regularly Review Access**: Periodically audit permissions to prevent privilege creep.
> - **Implement Multi-Layered Policies**: Use layered access controls for sensitive data.
> - **Log and Monitor Access**: Track authorization logs to detect and respond to anomalies.

## Conclusion

Authorization is essential for securing access to resources by controlling user actions based on predefined permissions. It complements authentication by ensuring that authenticated users interact only with resources theyâ€™re allowed to access, reinforcing security, compliance, and operational efficiency.
