# Fault Tolerance

## Overview

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. This is a crucial aspect of designing reliable and resilient distributed systems, ensuring that services remain available and operational despite faults.

## Key Concepts

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Redundancy**: Incorporates multiple instances of critical components to provide backup in case of failure.
> - **Failover**: Automatically switches to a standby system or component when the primary one fails.
> - **Replication**: Duplicates data and processes across different nodes or locations to prevent data loss and maintain availability.
> - **Error Detection and Recovery**: Identifies and corrects errors to minimize their impact on the system.
> - **Automatic Failover**: Switches to backup components or systems when failures are detected, ensuring continuous operation.
> - **Data Replication**: Ensures data is copied across multiple nodes to prevent loss and maintain consistency.
> - **Error Handling**: Implements mechanisms to detect, log, and recover from errors to maintain system stability.
