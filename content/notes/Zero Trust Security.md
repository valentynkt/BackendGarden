# Zero Trust Security

## Overview

Zero Trust Security is a security model that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional security models that assume everything inside an organization's network is trustworthy, Zero Trust Security assumes that threats can exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources, regardless of their location.

## Key Concepts

> [!important]
> 
> - **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems are given the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.
> - **Micro-Segmentation**: Dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of threats.
> - **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring and verifying user and device identities and behaviors.
> - **Strong Authentication**: Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other robust methods to verify identities.
> - **Encryption**: Protecting data in transit and at rest through strong encryption techniques.

## How It Works

> [!info] **Zero Trust Security Process**
> 
> 1. **Verify Identity**: Use strong authentication methods like MFA to verify the identity of users and devices.
> 2. **Enforce Least Privilege**: Grant the minimum access necessary for users and devices to perform their tasks.
> 3. **Micro-Segment Network**: Isolate network segments to limit the spread of threats.
> 4. **Continuous Monitoring and Logging**: Regularly monitor and log user and device activities to detect and respond to anomalies.
> 5. **Encrypt Data**: Protect data in transit and at rest using strong encryption methods.
> 6. **Regularly Update Policies**: Continuously review and update security policies to adapt to new threats and organizational changes.
