# Passwordless Authentication

## Overview

Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity without the need for a password. Instead of traditional passwords, it uses alternative methods such as biometric data, hardware tokens, or one-time codes sent to an email or phone. This approach enhances security and user convenience by eliminating the risks associated with password management and breaches.
