# Passwordless Authentication
## Overview

Passwordless authentication is a modern authentication approach that verifies a userâ€™s identity without relying on traditional passwords. Instead, it uses alternative methods like biometric data, hardware tokens, or one-time codes sent to a userâ€™s email or phone, enhancing both security and convenience. This method mitigates risks associated with password management, such as breaches, phishing, and password reuse.

## Authentication Methods

Passwordless authentication can be implemented using a variety of methods, each providing different levels of security and user experience:

> [!summary]
> 
> - **[[Email Link Authentication]]**: A secure, one-time link sent to the user's registered email, allowing login without a password.
> - **SMS or Email OTP (One-Time Password)**: A unique code sent to the userâ€™s phone or email, which must be entered to complete authentication.
> - **[[Biometric Authentication]]**: Verifies identity using physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice.
> - **[[Push Notification Authentication]]**: Sends a notification to the userâ€™s device, requiring approval for login.
> - **[[Hardware Token Authentication]]**: Uses physical devices like security keys or tokens to authenticate users.

## Why Use Passwordless Authentication?

Passwordless authentication offers several benefits over traditional password-based systems:

> [!info] **Benefits**
> 
> - **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates risks associated with password-based attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attempts.
> - **Improved User Convenience**: Simplifies the login process by removing the need to remember and enter complex passwords.
> - **Reduced IT Overhead**: Reduces support costs related to password resets and management, saving time and resources for IT teams.

## How Passwordless Authentication Works

The passwordless authentication flow generally follows these steps:

1. **User Request**: The user initiates login by entering an identifier, like an email or phone number.
2. **Authentication Method**: The system sends a one-time code, link, or notification to the userâ€™s registered contact method or device.
3. **User Action**: The user takes action, such as clicking a link, entering a code, or approving a notification.
4. **Verification**: The system verifies the userâ€™s action, granting access if successful.

## Pros/Cons


> [!success] **Pros**
> 
> - **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of password-based vulnerabilities.
> - **Better User Experience**: Streamlines the login process, creating a more user-friendly experience.
> - **Lower IT Costs**: Decreases the need for password-related support, freeing up IT resources.

> [!danger] **Cons**
> 
> - **Device Dependency**: Authentication relies on the security and availability of the userâ€™s devices.
> - **Implementation Complexity**: May require significant modifications to existing systems and workflows.
> - **User Adjustment**: Users accustomed to passwords may need time to adapt to new methods.
