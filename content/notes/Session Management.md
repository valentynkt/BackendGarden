## Overview

Web session management is essential for maintaining user state and session information across multiple requests in web applications. Given that HTTP is a stateless protocol, session management techniques are employed to persist user interactions and data across multiple requests, ensuring a seamless and personalized user experience.

## Key Session Management Techniques

> [!summary]- Techniques
> 
> - **[[Web Cookies]]**: Used to store session data on the client side.
> - **[[Web Server-Side Sessions]]**: Stores session data on the server, with a session ID stored in a client-side cookie.
> - **[[Web Local Storage]]**: HTML5 feature for storing data on the client side with no expiration date.
> - **[[Web Session Storage]]**: HTML5 feature similar to local storage, but data is cleared when the page session ends.
> - **[[Web Tokens]]**: Encrypted tokens like [[JSON Web Tokens|JSON Web Tokens (JWT)]] used for maintaining user sessions.

## How Session Management Works

> [!info]- How It Works
> 
> 1. **User Authentication**: When a user logs in, the server generates a session and assigns a unique session ID.
> 2. **Session ID Storage**: The session ID is stored on the client-side, typically in a cookie.
> 3. **Request Handling**: For each subsequent request, the client sends the session ID to the server.
> 4. **Session Validation**: The server validates the session ID and retrieves the corresponding session data.
> 5. **Session Termination**: Sessions can be terminated explicitly (e.g., user logs out) or implicitly (e.g., session timeout).

## Best Practices

> [!example]- Recommendations
> 
> - **Use Secure Cookies**: Mark cookies as secure to ensure they are only sent over HTTPS.
> - **Set HttpOnly Flag**: Use the HttpOnly flag to prevent client-side scripts from accessing cookies.
> - **Implement Session Expiration**: Set expiration times for sessions to minimize security risks.
> - **Regenerate Session IDs**: Regenerate session IDs upon login to prevent session fixation attacks.
> - **Use Strong Encryption**: Encrypt session data and tokens to protect against unauthorized access.
