# Landscape

## MoC: [[Patterns In General]]

This landscape explores the foundational concepts of software patterns, breaking them down into two major categories, each represented as a Map of Contents (MoC).

### [[Architectural Patterns]]

- **Overview**: Delve into the structural aspects of software design through various architectural patterns. This MoC helps you understand how different architectures dictate the overall design and flow of systems.
- **Key Patterns**: Includes discussions on MVC (Model-View-Controller), Microservices, Monolithic Architecture, and more.
- **Applications**: Each pattern is explored in terms of its use cases, benefits, and potential drawbacks in real-world applications.

### [[Design Patterns]]

- **Overview**: Focus on the reusable solutions to common software design problems that can be applied in various programming scenarios.
- **Key Patterns**: Covers Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, with detailed examples like Singleton, Adapter, Observer, and Factory patterns.
- **Usage Tips**: Practical advice on when and how to implement these patterns, along with code examples and scenarios.

## MoC: [[Object Oriented Programming]] (OOP)

This landscape provides a comprehensive look at Object-Oriented Programming, extending into the principles that underpin effective OOP practices and including a dedicated MoC for Design Principles.

### OOP Principles

- **Overview**: An introduction to the core principles of OOPâ€”Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- **Detailed Exploration**: Each principle discussed with examples to illustrate how they help in creating flexible and maintainable code.
- **Integrations**: How these principles integrate with real-world programming tasks and software design.

### [[Design Principles]]

- **Overview**: Explores broader design principles that guide software development beyond OOP-specific contexts.
- **Key Principles**: Includes SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) among others.
- **Application Examples**: Real-world applications of each principle, illustrating their importance and implementation in software development.
