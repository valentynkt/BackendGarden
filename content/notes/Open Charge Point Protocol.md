# Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)

## Overview

The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is an open standard for communication between electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and central management systems. Developed by the Open Charge Alliance (OCA), OCPP aims to ensure interoperability and flexibility in the EV charging infrastructure, allowing different brands and systems to work seamlessly together.
## Key Features

> [!summary] **Key Features**
> 
> - **Interoperability**: Enables charging stations from different manufacturers to work with various central systems.
> - **Scalability**: Supports expanding EV charging networks without compatibility issues.
> - **Security**: Provides mechanisms to ensure secure communication between charging stations and management systems.
> - **Flexibility**: Allows for the implementation of new functionalities and services over time.

## Versions

- **OCPP 1.2**: The initial version, offering basic functionalities for communication.
