# HTTP Basic Authentication

## Diagram

## Overview

HTTP Basic Authentication is a simple method for enforcing access control to web resources. It involves sending the user's credentials (username and password) encoded in Base64 with each [[HTTP]] request. It is best used with [[HTTPS]] to ensure credentials are transmitted securely.

## How HTTP Basic Authentication Works

1. **Client Request**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server for a protected resource.
2. **Server Challenge**: The server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status code and a `WWW-Authenticate` header.
3. **Client Response**: The client resends the request with an `Authorization` header containing the Base64-encoded credentials.
4. **Server Verification**: The server decodes the credentials, verifies them, and grants access if valid.

## Example

> [!example]- Request with Authorization
> REQUEST:
> ```http
> GET /protected-resource HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.com
> Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
> ```
>
> RESPONSE:
> ``` http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/json
> 
> {
>   "data": "This is the protected resource"
> }
> ```


## Best Practices

> [!important]- **Best Practices**
> 
> - **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all requests using Basic Authentication are made over HTTPS to protect credentials from being intercepted.
> - **Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies to make brute-force attacks more difficult.
> - **Combine with Other Methods**: Use in conjunction with other authentication methods, such as token-based authentication, for added security.
> - **Regular Monitoring**: Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activities and implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Pros and Cons

> [!success]- **Pros**
> 
> - **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use with minimal configuration.
> - **Compatibility**: Supported by virtually all HTTP clients and servers.
> - **Low Overhead**: Does not require complex setups or additional infrastructure.

> [!danger]- **Cons**
> 
> - **Lack of [[Encryption]]**: Basic [[Authentication]] sends credentials in an easily decoded format. Always use HTTPS to encrypt the data in transit.
> - **No [[Session Management]]**: Credentials are sent with every request, making it vulnerable to interception if not encrypted.
> - **Weak Credential Storage**: The server must securely store and manage user credentials, ideally using [[Cryptography Hashing|Hashing]] and [[Cryptography Salt|Salting]].
