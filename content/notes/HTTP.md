# HTTP
## HTTP
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is a protocol – or a prescribed order and syntax for presenting information – used for transferring data over a network. Most information that is sent over the Internet, including website content and API calls, uses the HTTP protocol. There are two main kinds of HTTP messages: requests and responses.

In the OSI model (see [[OSI model]] ?), HTTP is a [layer 7](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-layer-7/) protocol.
## Http Request/Response
HTTP requests are generated by a user's browser as the user interacts with web properties. For example, if a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser will send a series of "HTTP GET" requests for the content that appears on that page.

These HTTP requests all go to either an origin server or a proxy caching server, and that server will generate an HTTP response. HTTP responses are answers to HTTP requests.
## HTTP vs. HTTPS
HTTPS is HTTP with [[Cryptography Encryption]] and verification. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses [[SSL and TLS Protocols]] to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses, and to digitally sign those requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.

## HTTP/3
HTTP/3 is the third and latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It was previously known as HTTP-over-QUIC (**Quick UDP Internet Connections)**. QUIC was initially developed by Google and is the successor of HTTP/2. Companies like Google and Facebook already use QUIC to speed up the web.
