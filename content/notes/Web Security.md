# Web Security

> [!summary]- **Encryption and Data Protection**
> - **[[End-to-End Encryption]]**: Ensures data sent between two parties cannot be intercepted or tampered with, providing confidentiality and integrity.
> - **[[SSL and TLS Protocols]]**: Secure internet communications by encrypting data exchanged over the web, essential for web browsing, email, and more.
> - **[[Data Cryptography]]**: Secures data by transforming it into a format that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized users, using cryptographic algorithms and keys.


> [!summary]- **Network and Communication Security**
> - **[[VPN]]**: Virtual Private Networks secure and encrypt connections over less secure networks like the internet, protecting sensitive data and user identities.
> - **[[IPSec]] (Internet Protocol Security)**: A suite of protocols used to secure Internet communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session.
> - **[[SSH]] (Secure Shell)**: Provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, offering strong authentication and encrypted data communications between two computers.


> [!summary]- **Access Control and Threat Management**
> - **[[Authentication]]**: Techniques that ensure only authorized users can access a network or a resource, including methods like passwords, biometrics, two-factor authentication (2FA), and digital certificates.
> - **[[Authorization]]**: The process of granting or denying specific permissions to users, groups, or roles to access resources or perform operations within a network or application environment.
> - SSO ([[Single Sign-On]])
> - **[[WAF]] (Web Application Firewall)**: Protects web applications from attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic, effective against threats like XSS and SQL injection.


> [!summary]- **Infrastructure and Protocol Enhancements**
> - **[[IPv4 vs IPv6]]**: Details the functionalities and improvements brought by IPv6 over IPv4, enhancing security capabilities and simplifying network configuration.
