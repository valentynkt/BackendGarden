# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## Overview

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network or system activities to detect unauthorized access, suspicious behavior, or security policy violations. IDS provides early warnings, helping organizations identify and respond to threats before damage occurs.

## Key Concepts

> [!important]
> 
> - **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**: Monitors network traffic for malicious activity, analyzing data packets and network protocols.
> - **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**: Installed on individual devices, monitors system activities, and detects unauthorized changes.
> - **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifies known attack patterns based on a database of signatures.
> - **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Detects unusual patterns by learning baseline behaviors and flagging deviations.

## How IDS Works

1. **Monitoring**: Continuously observes network or system activities.
2. **Detection**: Compares activities against known threats or baseline behaviors.
3. **Alerting**: Sends alerts for suspicious activities, allowing rapid response.

## Benefits

> [!success]
>  **Early Threat Detection**: Helps prevent security breaches by identifying unusual behavior quickly.
> **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the potential impact of attacks by providing real-time alerts.

## Best Practices

> [!important]
> 
> - **Regularly Update Signatures**: Keeps IDS effective against evolving threats.
> - **Use in Combination with Firewalls**: Improves overall network security.
> - **Tune for Minimum False Positives**: Ensures accurate detection by adjusting IDS parameters.
