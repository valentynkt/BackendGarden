# High Availability

## Overview

High availability (HA) refers to the design and implementation of systems that are continuously operational and accessible with minimal downtime. This is achieved through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing, ensuring that services remain available even in the event of hardware or software failures.

## Key Concepts

> [!important]
> 
> - **Redundancy**: Incorporates multiple instances of critical components to provide backup in case of failure. By duplicating components and services, the system can switch to backup instances without interrupting service.
>     
> - **[[Fault Tolerance|Failover]]**: Automatically switches to a standby system or component when the primary one fails. This ensures continuous operation even if a primary component encounters an issue.
>     
> - **[[Load Balancing]]**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, improving system availability. This also helps in rerouting traffic in case of server failures.
>     
> - **Clustering**: Groups multiple servers together to work as a single unit, enhancing reliability and scalability. Clustering provides redundancy and helps in managing failover seamlessly.
>     
> - **Monitoring and Detection**: Continuously monitors system components to detect failures or performance issues, enabling automatic failover and quick recovery.
>     
> - **[[Data Replication]]**: Ensures data is copied across multiple nodes to prevent loss and maintain consistency, which is crucial for recovery and maintaining data integrity.
