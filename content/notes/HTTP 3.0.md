# HTTP 3.0

HTTP/3 is the latest evolution of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([[HTTP]]), integrating the benefits of [[HTTP 2.0|HTTP/2.0]] with the advanced capabilities of the [[QUIC Protocol]] to push web performance and security to new heights.

## Introduction to HTTP/3

Developed to surpass the capabilities of HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, HTTP/3 utilizes [[UDP]] instead of [[TCP]] for data transmission, incorporating the efficiency and speed of QUIC. This adoption marks a significant shift aimed at overcoming the traditional challenges associated with [[TCP]] connections.

## Key Features of HTTP/3
