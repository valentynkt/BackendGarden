## Overview

Message Brokers are middleware systems designed to facilitate the exchange of messages between different applications or services. They decouple the sender and receiver, allowing them to communicate asynchronously, which is crucial for building scalable and resilient systems.

> [!NOTE]
>  This allows applications to share information with one another, even if theyâ€™re written in different programming languages!

## Key Concepts

### Components

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Producer**: The application responsible for sending messages. Itâ€™s connected with the message broker. In the publish/subscribe pattern, they are called `publishers`.
> - **Consumer**: The endpoint that consumes messages waiting in the message broker. In the publish/subscribe pattern, they are called `subscribers`.
> - **Queue/Topic**: A storage mechanism in the message broker used to store messages.

### Messaging Systems

Message Brokers are integral to [[Message-driven Architecture Pattern|Message-driven Architecture]], where the communication between components is achieved through asynchronous messaging. They support various communication patterns and ensure reliable message delivery.

> [!important]
> 
> - **Message-Driven Architecture**: An architectural style where components communicate by sending and receiving messages via a messaging system, allowing for loose coupling and asynchronous interactions.

### Topics and Queues

- **[[Message Queues|Queues]]**: In a queue, each message is processed by a single consumer. This pattern is often used in point-to-point messaging, where a message is directed from one sender to one receiver.
- **[[Message Topics|Topics]]**: In a topic, each message can be processed by multiple consumers. This pattern is typically used in publish/subscribe messaging, where messages are broadcast to multiple subscribers.

### Messaging Patterns

- **Point-to-Point Messaging ([[Message Queues]])**: Messages are sent to a specific queue and consumed by a single receiver. This ensures that each message is processed only once.

- **Publish/Subscribe Messaging ([[Message Topics]])**: Messages are published to a topic and can be consumed by multiple subscribers, allowing for broad distribution of information.

## Types of Message Brokers


>[!summary]
> 
> - **[[Apache Kafka]]**:  An [[Event Streaming]] platform (is not a message broker) for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming, supporting both publish-subscribe and point-to-point models.
> 
> - **[[RabbitMQ]]**: An open-source message broker supporting multiple protocols, including [[AMQP]], with various queue types for different needs.
> 
> - **[[Azure Service Bus]]**: A managed enterprise message broker with queues and publish-subscribe topics, offering advanced features like sessions and dead-lettering.
> 
> - **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: A real-time messaging service for sending and receiving messages between independent applications, supporting topics and subscriptions.
> 
> - **[[Database Backed Queue]]**: Uses a relational or NoSQL database as a queue. Suitable for applications that already use a database and need a simple queueing mechanism.
> 
> - **[[Redis]]**: An in-memory data structure store that can be used as a message broker with support for publish-subscribe and list-based queues, offering high performance and low latency.
> 
> - **[[Amazon MQ]]**: A managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that supports both pub/sub and point-to-point messaging patterns.
> 
> - **[[AWS  SQS]], [[AWS SNS]]**: A fully managed service that decouples and scales microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
> 
> - **[[Apache ActiveMQ]]**: An open-source message broker that supports pub/sub and point-to-point messaging, along with advanced features for reliable messaging.

## Summary

Message Brokers are essential components in modern distributed systems, enabling asynchronous communication and enhancing the scalability, flexibility, and reliability of applications. By understanding the key concepts, patterns, and types of message brokers, developers can effectively leverage these tools to build robust and responsive systems.
