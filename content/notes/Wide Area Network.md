# Wide Area Network (WAN)

## Overview

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that spans large geographical distances, connecting multiple LANs and other networks across cities, countries, or even globally. WANs use public infrastructure like telephone lines, fiber optics, and satellite links to connect remote devices and offices. The Internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting billions of devices globally.

## Key Features

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Geographical Scope**: Covers large areas, from cities to countries or even continents.
> - **Public or Private**: WANs can operate over public infrastructure or private leased lines.
> - **Slower Speed**: Data transmission speeds are usually slower compared to LANs, depending on the technology used.
> - **Complex Connectivity**: WANs often rely on multiple types of media (fiber optics, satellites, etc.) and networking technologies.
> - **Shared Resources Over Distance**: Allows organizations to share resources and connect across vast distances.

## How It Works

WANs connect LANs and other networks using routers, modems, and leased communication lines provided by telecommunications companies. Here's how WAN operates:

1. **Connection Setup**: WANs use routers to connect multiple LANs and remote networks.
2. **Data Transmission**: Data is sent over long distances using fiber optic cables, satellite links, or other media, passing through multiple network nodes.
3. **Routing**: Routers are used to direct data across the network, often passing through various intermediate networks.
4. **Security**: [[VPN|VPNs]] and [[Network Firewall|Firewall]] are commonly used to secure data transmitted over public infrastructure.
5. **Public Infrastructure**: WANs often use public telecommunication networks to enable long-distance communication.

## Common Use Cases

- **Global Enterprises**: Connecting offices and data centers across different countries or continents.
- **Telecommunication Networks**: Providing internet access and telecommunication services worldwide.
- **Educational Institutions**: Universities use WANs to connect remote campuses and allow students to access resources from anywhere.

## Security Considerations

- **[[VPN|Virtual Private Networks]] (VPN)**: Used to encrypt and secure data as it travels across public networks.
- **Firewalls**: Protect WANs from unauthorized access and security threats.
- **Encryption**: Ensures that sensitive data remains secure as it passes through different nodes in the WAN.

## Benefits

> - **Global Connectivity**: Enables communication between LANs across vast distances.
> - **Resource Sharing**: Allows remote offices and teams to share resources and collaborate efficiently.
> - **Centralized Management**: WANs allow centralized control and management of distributed networks.
