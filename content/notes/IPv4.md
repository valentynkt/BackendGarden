# IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

## Overview

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and a core protocol that routes most of the internet traffic today. It uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for 2^32 addresses (over 4 billion addresses).

## Key Features of IPv4

- **32-bit Addressing**: IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, divided into four octets, separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Subnetting**: Allows for the creation of multiple network segments within a single network, enhancing routing efficiency.
- **Address Types**: Includes unicast, broadcast, and multicast addresses to facilitate different types of communication.


> [!warning] Addressing Limitations
> The limited number of available IPv4 addresses has led to the development of [[IPv6]] to accommodate the expanding need for more internet addresses.


> [!info] Common Use
> IPv4 is used in almost all internet services for tasks ranging from web browsing to email. It operates invisibly to the average user, providing the necessary routing and addressing that powers the internet.
