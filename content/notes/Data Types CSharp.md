# Data Types

## Overview

Data types specify the type of data that a valid C# variable can hold. C# is a **strongly typed programming language** because each type of data (such as integer, character, float, etc.) is predefined as part of the language, and all constants or variables must be described with one of these data types.

**Data types in C# are mainly divided into three categories:**

> - [[#Value Types]]
> - [[#Reference Types]]
> - [[#Pointer Types]]
