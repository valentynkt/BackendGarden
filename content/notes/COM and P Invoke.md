# COM and P/Invoke

## Overview

Interoperability in C# is the ability of managed code (like C#) to interact with unmanaged code (such as native Windows APIs, COM components, or other code written in languages like C or C++). The two primary mechanisms in C# for achieving this are **[[Component Object Model CSharp|COM]] (Component Object Model)** and **[[Platform Invocation Services CSharp|P/Invoke]] (Platform Invocation Services)**.

## [[Component Object Model CSharp|COM]]
![[Component Object Model CSharp#COM (Component Object Model)]]

## [[Platform Invocation Services CSharp|P/Invoke]]
![[Platform Invocation Services CSharp#Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke)]]

## Summary

**COM** and **P/Invoke** are powerful tools for interoperability in C#, allowing managed code to interact with unmanaged components, whether they are legacy COM objects or system-level APIs. While both approaches have their complexities, they are essential for scenarios where leveraging existing unmanaged code is necessary.
