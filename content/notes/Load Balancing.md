# Load Balancing

## Overview

Load balancing is a technique used to distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It improves the availability and reliability of applications by distributing workloads more evenly, enhancing performance and preventing server overload.
## Key Concepts

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Distribution**: Evenly distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers.
> - **[[High Availability]]**: Ensures continuous operation by redirecting traffic to healthy servers if one fails.
> - **[[Scaling|Scalability]]**: Facilitates horizontal scaling by adding more servers to handle increased load.
> - **Health Monitoring**: Continuously checks the health of servers to route traffic only to those that are operational.

## Types of Load Balancers

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices that distribute traffic.
> - **Software Load Balancers**: Software applications that manage traffic distribution.
> - **Cloud Load Balancers**: Load balancing services provided by cloud providers, such as [[AWS Elastic Load Balancing]] (ELB) and [[Azure Load Balancer]].

## Load Balancing Algorithms

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially among servers.
> - **Least Connections**: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
> - **IP Hash**: Distributes requests based on client IP address.
> - **Weighted Distribution**: Assigns different weights to servers, directing more traffic to more powerful servers.
