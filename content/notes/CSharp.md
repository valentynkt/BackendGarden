# CSharp (C#)

## Overview

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]] language developed by Microsoft as part of the [[NET|.NET]] initiative. It is widely used for developing a variety of applications, ranging from [[Web]] and mobile applications to game development and enterprise software. This note serves as a central hub for exploring key concepts, best practices, and advanced topics in C#.

## General Information

C# was designed with simplicity, efficiency, and type safety in mind. It combines the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic. C# is utilized to develop secure and robust applications running on the .NET Framework and is standardized by [[ECMA]] and [[ISO]], with a rich set of libraries that integrate seamlessly into the .NET ecosystem.

### History and Evolution

- **Introduced by Microsoft**: 2000
- **Standardized by ECMA**: 2002
- **Continuous Evolution**: New features and improvements are added with each version, enhancing language capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Strongly Typed Language**: Enforces type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- **Multi-Paradigm Support**: Object-oriented, imperative, declarative, and functional programming.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: With a built-in [[Garbage Collector]].
- **Data Manipulation with LINQ**: Integrated query capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Via [[Async and Await Keywords]].
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Through .NET Core and .NET 5+.
