# Integration Testing

## Overview

Regression Testing is a type of software testing that ensures that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. This testing is crucial for maintaining software quality and stability after updates, bug fixes, or enhancements.

## Key Concepts

- **Validation**: Ensures that new changes do not introduce new bugs or break existing features.
- **Automation**: Often automated to save time and resources, especially for large and complex applications.
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistent functionality and performance after code modifications.

## How Regression Testing Works

1. **Identify Test Cases**: Select existing test cases that cover the functionalities likely to be affected by recent changes.
2. **Execute Tests**: Run the selected test cases to validate the application's behavior.
3. **Compare Results**: Compare the results of the tests with previous test runs to detect any discrepancies.
4. **Report Issues**: Log any defects or issues discovered during testing.
