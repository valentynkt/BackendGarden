# Email Link Authentication

## Overview

Email Link Authentication is a passwordless method where users log in by clicking a one-time link sent to their email. This approach enhances security and simplifies the login process by eliminating passwords.

## How It Works

1. **User Login Request**: The user enters their email on the login page.
2. **Link Generation**: The server creates a one-time link and sends it to the userâ€™s email.
3. **User Clicks Link**: The user clicks the link in their email, redirecting them to the application.
4. **Access Granted**: The server verifies the link and grants access.
