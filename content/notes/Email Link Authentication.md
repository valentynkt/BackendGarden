# Email Link Authentication

## Overview

Email Link Authentication is a [[Passwordless Authentication]] method where users log in by clicking a one-time link sent to their email address. This method enhances security by eliminating the need for passwords and simplifying the user login process.

## How It Works

1. **User Initiates Login**: The user enters their email address on the login page.
2. **Send Authentication Link**: The server generates a one-time link and sends it to the user's email.
3. **User Clicks Link**: The user clicks the link in their email, which redirects them to the application.
4. **Access Granted**: The server verifies the link and grants the user access.
