# IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

## Overview

IPv6 is the most recent version of the [[Internet Protocol]], designed to address the exhaustion of addresses provided by its predecessor, [[IPv4]]. It uses a 128-bit address system that significantly increases the number of available [[Internet Protocol|IP]] addresses.

## Key Features of IPv6

- **128-bit Addressing**: IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, greatly expanding address capacity to approximately 340 undecillion addresses.
- **Simplified Header**: Streamlined packet processing with a simpler header compared to [[IPv4]].
- **Improved Security**: Built-in support for [[IPSec]] (Internet Protocol Security), providing robust network security at the IP layer.
- **No More NAT**: With the vast address space, Network Address Translation (NAT) is no longer necessary, simplifying network configuration and improving end-to-end connectivity.
- **Autoconfiguration**: Supports stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), allowing devices to configure themselves automatically when connected to an IPv6 network.



> [!success] Addressing Enhancements
> IPv6 addresses are typically written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). This notation can be simplified using rules to compress zeros.
