# .NET

## Introduction

The .NET Framework is a robust and versatile software development platform developed by Microsoft. It is designed to create a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and cloud-based applications. The .NET Framework provides a comprehensive environment for developers, featuring a large class library, seamless language interoperability, and a managed runtime that handles the execution of programs.

---

## Key Components

The .NET Framework is built on several foundational components, each of which plays a critical role in the platform's functionality:

- **[[Common Language Runtime|Common Language Runtime (CLR)]]**: The execution engine that handles running applications, providing services such as memory management, security, and exception handling.
- **[[Framework Class Library|Framework Class Library (FCL)]]**: A vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that expedite and simplify application development.
- **[[Common Language Specification|Common Language Specification (CLS)]]**: A set of rules that ensures interoperability between different .NET languages.
- **[[Common Type System|Common Type System (CTS)]]**: Standardizes the data types used in different .NET languages, ensuring compatibility.

These components are essential for developing applications on the .NET Framework and are well-integrated to provide a seamless development experience.

## .NET Languages

The .NET Framework supports multiple programming languages, allowing developers to choose the language that best fits their needs while maintaining interoperability with other .NET languages. Some of the popular .NET languages include:

- **[[CSharp|C#]]**: A modern, object-oriented language designed for building a wide range of applications.
- **VB.NET**: A high-level language derived from BASIC, designed for rapid application development.
- **[[FSharp|F#]]**: A functional-first programming language that also supports object-oriented and procedural programming.
- **C++/CLI**: A version of C++ specifically designed for the .NET environment.

These languages are fully supported by the .NET Framework, enabling developers to write code in the language of their choice while leveraging the power of the .NET platform.

## Related Technologies

The .NET ecosystem includes a variety of technologies specifically designed for web, mobile, and cloud-based development. These technologies extend the capabilities of the .NET Framework and enable developers to build modern, scalable applications.

### [[ASP.NET]]

**ASP.NET** is a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications. It provides a rich set of tools and libraries for developing everything from small websites to large, enterprise-level web applications. ASP.NET supports multiple programming models, including:

- **ASP.NET Web Forms**: A traditional model for building web applications with a focus on event-driven programming.
- **ASP.NET [[Model-View-Controller Pattern|MVC]]**: A model-view-controller framework that promotes a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complex applications.
- **ASP.NET Web API**: A framework for building [[REST API|RESTful]] services that can be consumed by a variety of clients, including web browsers, mobile devices, and desktop applications.
- **ASP.NET Core**: The next generation of ASP.NET, designed as a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications, APIs, and microservices.

### [[Blazor]]

**Blazor** is a modern web framework that enables developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. Blazor can be used for:

- **Blazor Server**: Runs on the server and interacts with the client over SignalR.
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Runs directly in the browser using WebAssembly, providing a true client-side experience.

### Xamarin

**Xamarin** is a framework for building mobile applications using .NET and C#. It allows developers to create native iOS, Android, and Windows apps with a shared codebase, making cross-platform development more efficient.

### [[Azure]] Integration

The .NET ecosystem is tightly integrated with Microsoft Azure, offering a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing cloud-based applications. This includes support for:

- **Azure Functions**: A serverless computing service that enables you to run event-driven code without provisioning or managing infrastructure.
- **Azure App Service**: A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.
- **Azure DevOps**: Tools for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to automate the deployment of .NET applications.

### [[Entity Framework]]

**Entity Framework (EF)** is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects. It simplifies data access by eliminating the need for most of the data-access code developers usually need to write.

## Evolution of .NET

Over the years, the .NET ecosystem has evolved to meet the changing needs of developers and the industry. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its evolution:

- **.NET Framework**: The original implementation, primarily designed for Windows applications.
- **.NET Core**: A cross-platform, open-source version of .NET that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, designed for building modern, cloud-based applications.
- **.NET 5 and Beyond**: A unified platform that consolidates .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin into a single platform for all types of applications.

Each evolution of .NET has brought new features and improvements, making it a powerful and flexible platform for modern application development.
