# Unit Testing

## Overview

Unit Testing involves testing individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly. Each unit, typically a function or method, is tested in isolation. Unit tests validate that these smallest parts of the application behave as expected, allowing early bug detection and resolution.

## How Unit Testing Works

1. **Identify Units**: Determine the smallest testable parts of the application.
2. **Write Test Cases**: Develop test cases specifying input, expected output, and conditions to check.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute the test cases to verify the unit's behavior.
4. **Check Results**: Compare the actual output with the expected output using assertions.
5. **Refactor and Repeat**: Refactor the code as needed and re-run the tests to ensure changes do not introduce new issues.

## Tools for Unit Testing

> [!summary] **Popular Unit Testing Tools**
> 
> - **NUnit (.NET)**: A testing framework for .NET languages, offering a rich set of assertions and test runners.
> - **xUnit (.NET)**: A free, open-source testing tool for .NET, supporting data-driven tests and parallel execution.

## Approaches to Unit Testing

> [!example] **[[Test-Driven Development]] (TDD)**
> 
> - **Description**: Tests are written before the code, ensuring thorough test coverage and promoting better design.

> [!example] **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
> 
> - **Description**: Tests are written in a human-readable format, enhancing collaboration between stakeholders. Often using the Given-When-Then syntax.

> [!example] **Mocking and Stubbing**
> 
> - **Description**: Techniques to simulate the behavior of dependencies, simplifying testing and improving reliability.

## Best Practices

> [!important] **Best Practices**
> 
> - **Follow the [[Tests Arange-Act-Assert Pattern |AAA Pattern]]**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to structure tests clearly, improving readability and maintainability.
> - **Write Small, Focused Tests**: Focus on a single aspect of the unit's functionality.
> - **Ensure Independence**: Tests should be independent and not rely on any specific order of execution.
> - **Use Descriptive Names**: Clearly describe what is being tested and the expected outcome.
> - **Automate Testing**: Integrate unit tests into the CI pipeline to ensure frequent execution.
> - **Maintain High Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage, prioritizing quality and relevance over quantity.
