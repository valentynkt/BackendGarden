# XML Syntax

> [!example]- Basic XML Document
> Here's an example of a basic XML document that includes a declaration, elements, attributes, and nested elements:
> 
> ```xml
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
> <bookstore>
>     <book id="b1">
>         <title>Understanding XML</title>
>         <author>John Doe</author>
>         <price currency="USD">29.99</price>
>     </book>
>     <book id="b2">
>         <title>Advanced XML Features</title>
>         <author>Jane Smith</author>
>         <price currency="USD">35.99</price>
>     </book>
> </bookstore>

> [!example]- Attributes vs. Elements
>  
> Attributes provide additional information about elements. Comparing storage as attributes or elements affects accessibility and readability:
>
>``` xml
><!-- Using attributes -->
><employee id="E123" department="Finance"/>
>
><!-- Using elements -->
><employee>
>    <id>E123</id>
>    <department>Finance</department>
></employee>
>
>```
> 
> Attributes are typically used for metadata, while elements handle data that could benefit from more structure.

> [!example]- Nested Elements
>
>``` xml
><university>
>    <department name="Engineering">
>        <faculty>Technology</faculty>
>        <students>
>            <student id="S1001">Alice</student>
>            <student id="S1002">Bob</student>
>        </students>
>    </department>
></university>
>
>```
>
> XML allows for complex data structures through nested elements, ideal for hierarchical data such as academic records or organizational charts:


> [!example]-  Special Characters and CDATA
> 
>CDATA sections are used to include special characters or unescaped data within XML documents:
>``` xml
><description>
>    <![CDATA[
>        This is a description text that can contain unescaped characters like <, >, or & without causing errors.
>    ]]>
></description>
>
>```
>CDATA sections ensure that the data inside is treated purely as text, not XML markup.
