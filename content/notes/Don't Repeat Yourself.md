# Don't Repeat Yourself

The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is a fundamental concept in software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. Its main intent is to enhance software maintainability and readability, which in turn reduces the chance of errors or bugs.

> [!important] Key Prinicples
> - **[[Code reuse|Code Reusability]]**: Encourages the use of functions, classes, and other constructs to avoid repetitive code.
> - **Simplification**: Simplifies understanding and modifying the code by having a single source of truth.
> - **Efficiency**: Reduces development time and increases efficiency by minimizing the need to write and test the same code multiple times.

The DRY principle is crucial in building scalable and error-free software, promoting a clean codebase where each piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous representation.
