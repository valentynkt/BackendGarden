# Design Principles

## Overview

Design principles are fundamental guidelines that help software developers create high-quality software. They provide a framework for making design decisions that enhance the maintainability, scalability, and robustness of software applications.

> [!abstract] 
> Good design principles streamline software development processes and ensure that software systems are easier to manage and adapt over time. They serve as the backbone for creating efficient, error-resistant, and adaptable software architectures.

### Key Concepts

Effective software design encompasses a set of core principles that guide developers in creating systems that are both functional and maintainable:

> [!important]
> 
> - **[[Code reuse]]**: Promotes the use of the same code in different parts of a software system, reducing redundancy and increasing reliability.
> - **[[Extensibility]]**: Allows software to be easily extended with new features without significant modifications to existing code.
> - **[[Encapsulate What Varies]]**: Encourages developers to isolate components that change frequently, protecting other parts of the system from extensive changes.
> - **[[Depend on Abstraction]]**: Suggests relying on abstract classes or interfaces instead of concrete implementations to reduce dependencies and enhance modularity.
> - **[[Favor Composition Over Inheritance]]**: Recommends using composition rather than inheritance to achieve [[code reuse]], which provides more flexibility and reduces the dependency hierarchy.
> - **[[SOLID Principles]]**: A set of five design principles that contribute to writing clean code that accommodates new features and changes with minimal effort.
> - [[Don't Repeat Yourself]] (DRY)
> - [[Keep It Short and Simple]] (KISS)
> - [[You Ain't Gonna Need It]] (YAGNI)
> - [[Law of Demeter]] (LoD)
