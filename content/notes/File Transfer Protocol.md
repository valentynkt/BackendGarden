# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

## Overview

FTP is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. It is built on a [[Client-Server Architecture Pattern|Client-Server Model]] architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

## Key Features of FTP

- **Data and Control Channels**: FTP uses two channels, a command (control) channel for controlling the conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content.
- **Anonymous Access**: Often allows users to access files with a generic username and without a password.
- **Active and Passive Modes**: Supports active and passive modes for establishing data connections.

## Usage

FTP is widely used for exchanging and manipulating files over any network that supports the [[TCP]]/IP protocol. It has applications in website management, corporate data transfer, and backup systems.
