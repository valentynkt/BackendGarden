# Data Integrity and Transactions

## Overview

![[../Files/Images/Pasted image 20240429200555.jpg]]

Data integrity and transactions are crucial in database management, ensuring that data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable during operations. These elements are vital for systems that demand high levels of data validity and consistency, particularly in environments where data is accessed concurrently.

## Key Concepts

**Data Integrity** refers to the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle. It is essential for the design, implementation, and usage of systems that store, process, or retrieve data.

> - **Constraints**: Utilizing primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints helps ensure data accuracy and reliability within the database.
> - **Normalization**: Properly organizing databases into tables and fields reduces redundancy and dependencies, thus enhancing data integrity.
> - **Error Handling**: Effective error management is crucial to maintain data integrity during operations.

**Transactions** are sequences of operations treated as a cohesive unit. If one part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database remains unchanged.

Transactions adhere to ACID properties

>   Manage transactions using [[SQL Operations|SQL Commands]] such as `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to control their execution and ensure data integrity, even when errors occur.
