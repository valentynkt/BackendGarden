# Class vs Struct vs Record

## Summary

- **Class**: A construct that enables you to create custom types by grouping together variables, methods, and events.
- **Struct**: A value type typically used to [[Encapsulation|Encapsulate]] small groups of related variables.
- **Record**: A class or struct that provides special syntax and behavior for working with data models.
- **Record Struct**: Similar to Record, but specifically for structs, not classes.

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Memory Allocation** | Stored on the heap                 | Stored on the stack                  | Stored on the heap                  | Stored on the stack                |
| **Performance**     | Slightly slower                    | Faster access                        | Slightly slower                     | Faster access                      |
| **Mutability**      | Mutable                            | Immutable/Mutable                    | Typically immutable                 | Typically immutable                |
| **Inheritance**     | Supported                          | Not supported                        | Supported                           | Not supported                      |
| **Encapsulation**   | Supported (private fields)         | Limited (fields are public by default) | Supported (private fields)          | Limited (fields are public by default) |
| **Default Constructors** | Generated if not defined         | Not generated                        | Generated if not defined            | Not generated                      |

## Key Points

- **Class**: Best for complex data structures that require inheritance and encapsulation.
- **Struct**: Best for small, simple data structures that benefit from stack allocation and value semantics.
- **Record**: Ideal for immutable data models with value-based equality semantics.
- **Record Struct**: Combines the benefits of records and structs for immutable value types stored on the stack.
