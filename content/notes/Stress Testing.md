# Stress Testing

## Overview

Stress Testing is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under extreme or unexpected load conditions. It aims to identify the system's breaking point and understand how it recovers from failure. This testing helps ensure that the system remains reliable and performs well under high-stress scenarios.

## Key Concepts

- **Load Conditions**: Stress testing involves applying load beyond the system's normal operating capacity.
- **Failure Points**: Identifies the system's breaking point and how it behaves under stress.
- **Recovery**: Evaluates the system's ability to recover from extreme load conditions.

## How Stress Testing Works

1. **Define Scenarios**: Determine the stress conditions, such as maximum user load, data volume, or transaction rate.
2. **Simulate Load**: Use tools to simulate the defined load conditions and apply them to the system.
3. **Monitor Performance**: Observe the system's behavior, including response time, throughput, and error rates.
4. **Analyze Results**: Identify the points of failure and evaluate the system's performance and stability under stress.
5. **Report Findings**: Document the results, highlighting the system's breaking point and recovery capabilities.
