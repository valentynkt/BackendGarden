# ASP.NET

## Introduction

**ASP.NET** is a web application framework developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET platform. It is used for building dynamic websites, web applications, and web services. ASP.NET allows developers to create robust and scalable web solutions using the .NET ecosystem, leveraging the power of languages like C# and VB.NET.

## Key Features of ASP.NET

> [!info] **Main Features**
> 
> - **Rich Development Environment**: Integrated with Visual Studio, offering tools like IntelliSense, debugging, and project templates.
> - **Server-Side Logic**: Supports writing server-side logic that runs on the web server before sending the response to the client.
> - **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complex applications.
> - **Web API**: Facilitates the creation of RESTful services that can be consumed by various clients.
> - **Cross-Platform with ASP.NET Core**: ASP.NET Core extends ASP.NET capabilities to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
> - **Security Features**: Built-in security features like authentication, authorization, and data protection.
> - **State Management**: Offers various techniques for managing state, such as sessions, cookies, and view state.
> - **Scalability and Performance**: Optimized for high performance and scalability, supporting modern web development practices.

## ASP.NET Components

ASP.NET consists of several key components and models that cater to different types of web applications:

### ASP.NET Web Forms

**ASP.NET Web Forms** is a traditional framework for building dynamic websites with a focus on event-driven development. It uses a drag-and-drop, designer-friendly approach, allowing developers to build web applications quickly with minimal code.

- **Event-Driven Programming**: Handles user events like button clicks directly in the code-behind.
- **Rapid Development**: Provides controls like GridView, FormView, and more for quick development.

### ASP.NET MVC

**ASP.NET MVC** is a design pattern that divides an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. This pattern promotes a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and test web applications.

- **Model**: Represents the application data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays the user interface.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and interacts with the model to render the appropriate view.

### ASP.NET Web API

**ASP.NET Web API** is a framework for building RESTful services that can be consumed by a variety of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and desktop applications.

- **RESTful Services**: Supports HTTP-based services following [[REST API|REST]] principles.
- **Content Negotiation**: Automatically selects the best response format (JSON, XML, etc.) based on client requests.

### ASP.NET Core

**ASP.NET Core** is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based web applications. It is a complete redesign of ASP.NET, optimized for speed and flexibility.

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Unified Framework**: Combines MVC, Web API, and Razor Pages into a single framework.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in support for dependency injection.
- **Razor Pages**: Simplified page-based programming model for web applications.

### [[Blazor]]

**Blazor** is a framework within ASP.NET that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It runs on WebAssembly, making it possible to execute C# code directly in the browser.

- **Blazor Server**: Runs on the server and updates the UI over SignalR.
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Runs directly in the browser using WebAssembly, providing a true client-side experience.

## Summary

ASP.NET is a powerful and versatile framework for building dynamic web applications and services. Whether youâ€™re developing traditional web forms, modern single-page applications, or RESTful APIs, ASP.NET provides the tools and libraries needed to create high-performance, secure, and scalable web solutions. With the evolution of ASP.NET Core and Blazor, it continues to be a leading choice for modern web development.
