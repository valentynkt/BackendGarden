# Long Polling

## Overview

Long polling is a technique used in web applications to maintain a persistent connection between the client and server. Unlike [[Short Polling]], which closes the connection after each request, long polling keeps the connection open until new data is available. This reduces the need for frequent requests and provides a near real-time update mechanism.

## How Long Polling Works

1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request to the server and keeps the connection open.
2. **Server Waits**: The server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
3. **Server Response**: When new data is available, the server responds with the updated information.
4. **Repeat**: The client immediately sends a new request after receiving the response, maintaining the connection.

## Pros/Cons

> [!success] Pros
> - **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of requests compared to short polling, lowering server load and network traffic.
> - **Reduced Latency**: Provides near real-time updates without the need for continuous polling.
> - **Simplicity**: Easier to implement than WebSockets and doesn't require special server configurations.

> [!danger] Cons
> - **Timeouts**: Requires careful management of timeouts to avoid connection drops.
> - **Server Resources**: Keeping connections open can consume server resources, especially with many concurrent clients.
> - **Latency**: While reduced compared to short polling, there is still some latency compared to more advanced real-time technologies.

## Use Cases

Long polling is suitable for applications that require near real-time updates but cannot use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events. Examples include:

- **Chat Applications**: Providing near real-time messaging without using WebSockets.
- **Notifications**: Delivering updates or alerts as soon as they become available.
- **Live Feeds**: Keeping data streams updated with minimal delay.

## Example Implementation

Here's a basic example of long polling using JavaScript and a RESTful API:

```javascript
function longPoll() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            console.log('Data:', data);
            // Process the data
            longPoll(); // Immediately start a new request
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error:', error);
            // Retry after a delay in case of error
            setTimeout(longPoll, 5000);
        });
}

// Start long polling
longPoll();
```
