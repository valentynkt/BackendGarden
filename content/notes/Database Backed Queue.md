# Database Backed Queue

## Overview

A database-backed queue leverages a relational or NoSQL database to implement a queuing mechanism. This approach is ideal for applications that already use a database and need a straightforward way to handle asynchronous processing and ensure persistence.

## Key Features

> [!summary]
> 
> - **Asynchronous Processing**: Allows for decoupling tasks, enabling systems to handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking.
> - **Persistence**: Ensures that messages are not lost in case of system failures, as they are stored in a durable database.
> - **Ease of Implementation**: Utilizes existing database infrastructure, making it easy to implement without additional message broker tools.

## How It Works

Using a Starbucks example, the two most critical requirements are asynchronous processing and persistence. In this scenario, the process flow is as follows:

1. **Cashier**: Creates a new order in the database-backed queue.
2. **Coffee Maker**: Picks up the new order, updates the state to IN_PROGRESS.
3. **Coffee Maker Response**: Processes the order and updates the status to DONE.
4. **Customer**: Picks up the completed order.

## Pros and Cons

> [!success] Pros
> 
> - **Simplicity**: Easy to implement using existing database infrastructure.
> - **Durability**: Ensures message persistence through database storage.
> - **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to various use cases with minimal setup.

> [!danger] Cons
> 
> - **Scalability**: Not suitable for high-throughput scenarios due to database constraints.
> - **Performance**: Can introduce latency compared to specialized message brokers.
