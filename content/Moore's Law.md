Moore's Law refers to an observation and prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. He noted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. This trend has held true for several decades and has become a [[Moore's Law as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|guiding principle for the semiconductor industry]].

Moore's Law **predicts the pace** of technological advancement and the increasing complexity of computer chips over time.

### Implications on Computing Power

As the number of transistors increases, computer chips can perform more complex calculations and process more data in a given time. This exponential growth in computing power has **enabled the development** of faster, more capable computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices. It has also **driven advancements** in fields such as [[Leveraging Computation Proves Most Effective in AI Research|artificial intelligence]], data analysis, and scientific simulations.

### Economic Impact of Moore's Law

Moore's Law has had a profound impact on the economics of the technology industry. As the number of transistors on a chip doubles, the cost per transistor decreases. This trend has made computing devices more affordable and accessible to a wider population. The increasing affordability of powerful computing devices has **spurred innovation** and **created new markets** for technology products and services.

### Challenges in Maintaining Moore's Law

As the size of transistors approaches the atomic scale, maintaining the pace of Moore's Law has become increasingly challenging. The laws of physics impose limitations on how small transistors can be made, and the cost of developing new manufacturing processes has risen significantly. These challenges have led some experts to **predict the end** of Moore's Law in the near future. However, researchers are exploring new technologies, such as quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, that could potentially **extend the life** of Moore's Law or provide alternative paths for increasing computing power.

### The Future of Technology

The continued advancement of computing power, even if at a slower pace, will likely **drive innovation** in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology. As computing devices become more powerful and energy-efficient, they will enable new applications and technologies that were previously impossible or impractical. The legacy of Moore's Law will continue to shape the development of technology and its impact on society for years to come.
