Need to tell a story. Humans love stories and [[Memory works better in story form|can remember more with stories]]. If the audience can relate to a character, they can begin to [[Empathy builds relationships|feel empathy]] for the character.

Once the audience knows and empathizes with the character, you can use the story to evoke emotions in the character which should translate to the audience.

Emotions mess with [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|how people percieve things]] and you can help the audience along their journey of experiencing emotions with motion/set/lighting/color/sound/music design and how the story is framed.

You can also use [[Humor is a benign violation of expectations|irony/meta]] to have the audience experience something different outside of the character's experience.
