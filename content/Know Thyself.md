# Know Thyself

Socrates famously said, "the unexamined life is not worth living."

> Knowing yourself has extraordinary prestige in our culture. It has been framed as quite literally the meaning of life.
> - [[Socrates and how to develop self-knowledge]]

This idea of self-knowledge being the meaning of life yields many questions:

1. Just why is self-knowledge such a prestigious good?
2. Why is self-knowledge difficult to attain?
3. What are the dangers that come with a lack of self-knowledge?
4. What do we in fact need to know about ourselves?
5. How do we come to learn such things?

## What's the point?

The most glaring and obvious reason to know yourself is that it [[Accept yourself for who you are|leads to greater happiness and fulfillment]].

We are all pretty crazy with our own set of idiosyncrasies and neuroses that if we don't take the time to understand, we won't know [[Self-knowledge yields independence of mind|what we really want out of life]].


## It's difficult to know yourself

[[Materialism is detrimental to society|Our society historically is very materialistic]] and does not value as much as it should self-reflection. 90s kids such as myself grew up in an environment where it was "manly" to suppress your feelings and emotions: a form of [[Toxic masculinity|toxic masculinity]].

Our [[Emotions vs Feelings vs Thoughts|feelings and emotions]] [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|deeply affect us]] and need to be [[Emotions need to be felt|felt]] and [[Understanding Your Emotions|understood to understand ourselves]]. This can be very difficult and requires active participation to [[What does it mean to process thoughts|process them]].

Due to our [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|complex emotional depth]] that seems to define [[Actions Define Us|every aspect of our character]], it's important to fully understand our emotions to [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|understand and know ourselves]].

[[Emotions need to be felt|Emotions need to be felt]] to fully understand our thoughts, actions, and ultimately yourself.

Failing to fully understand yourself has real consequences. You will be at the [[Self-knowledge yields independence of mind|whims of other people's opinions]] not able to [[Self-knowledge allows easier decision making|make clear decisions]].

It's especially important to understand yourself if you want a chance at any kind of [[Accept yourself for who you are|fulfilling relationship with yourself]] or [[Emotional Intelligence is our understanding of others|others]].
