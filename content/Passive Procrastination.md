This mode out of procrastination is **unintentional**. It is characterized by what people normally think of when they think of "procrastination."

This is the "head-in-the-sand" approach where someone avoids thinking about the task that they dread.

It is mentally draining since it's never actually taken off the procrastinator's mental plate.

This differs from [[Active Procrastination|active procrastination in intentionality]] and [[Active Procrastination Outcomes|outcome]].
