*Passive procrastination* is not a deliberate choice, but rather, it is **unintentional**. This form of procrastination is typically what comes to mind for most individuals when they hear the term "procrastination." It is the quintessential representation of the habit, embodying the classic **avoidance behavior** that is all too often associated with the act of procrastinating.

When we refer to this form of procrastination, we often describe it as the "head-in-the-sand" approach. This metaphor effectively captures the essence of the behavior. Instead of taking active steps to address and complete the task, they choose to ignore its existence, hoping that it will somehow disappear or resolve itself.

This behavior can have its roots in [[Emotions need to be felt|emotional avoidance]] or deeper [[Finding motivation for someone with ADHD can be very difficult|motivational issues]].

On the surface, it might seem like the easy way out, but it actually proves to be mentally taxing over time. The reason for this is simple: even though the task is being outwardly ignored, it never truly leaves the procrastinator's mental sphere. It simply retreats into the subconscious where it remains, hovering like a dark cloud, constantly reminding them of its presence. This **perpetual state of stress and anxiety** is draining, creating a [[Journaling is an effective way to process our emotions|mental burden that is hard to shake off]].

Such a mode of procrastination is fundamentally different from [[Active Procrastination|active procrastination]] in its intentionality and outcome. Active procrastination is a conscious choice, often employed by those who thrive under pressure and use the impending deadline as a source of motivation. The outcome, in this case, is usually positive, resulting in high-quality work produced in a limited timeframe. On the other hand, the unintentional nature of this "head-in-the-sand" approach often leads to rushed, mediocre results, or even missed deadlines, due to the lack of timely action and the mental exhaustion it induces.
