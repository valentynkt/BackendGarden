To avoid replacing current information gatekeepers with a single dominant [[AI Agents Will Serve Individuals and Organizations|AI agent]] or system, fostering an *open* and *interoperable* AI ecosystem will be essential.

Open source technologies can play a key role by enabling a diversity of AI agents and services that can interface with each other.

Standardized data formats and API protocols will also be important to allow different newsrooms' and individuals' AI agents to efficiently exchange information and work together. A competitive landscape with many different AI providers will help maintain user choice and prevent over-centralization of power.
