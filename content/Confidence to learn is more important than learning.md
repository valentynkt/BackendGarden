This is mostly in the context of raising a child.

While Carson is in lower school, I think it's more important that we foster the confidence in him that he can learn anything he wants by putting forth the effort and practice.

In other words, we should judge not by his progress on specific milestones (like whether he is pronouncing his "sh" sound yet), but on whether or not his desire to learn is there. It's more important to me that he understands *how* to learn at this point rather than the learning.

I want him to *know* and *feel* that **he can do anything he wants to do**.
