We need to understand how the intelligence works. We need to understand the mechanisms. Peer into the "parts" of the forming artificial brain.

It takes a long time to do that work well.

We need to understand the AI intentions. It's being trained to "fool" humans or optimize to convince humans for a thumbs up. Relate this to dopamine.

We are out of time.
