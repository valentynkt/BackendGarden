### Tips

#### Keep prompts short

The AI needs to know what the focus and subject of the image is.

#### Stay focused

Achieve one thing with each image. Stay on topic. You can augment in photoshop later.

#### Aspect Ratio

`2:3` or `3:2` work better with `v4`.

`--ar 4:6 --v 4`

#### Think like a Photographer

Camera angle can be changed, lighting can be changed, depth of field. Imagine what a photographer would do with an image and tell the AI using photography terms.
