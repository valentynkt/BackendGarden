Kaizen, a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement in all aspects of life, advocates for **small, incremental changes** rather than large, radical overhauls.

This approach applies to personal development, work processes, and even the management of one's living spaces.

By emphasizing consistent, gradual improvement, kaizen promotes a sustainable [[The Value of Failure in Personal and Professional Growth|path to excellence]]. It recognizes that large goals often require small, steady steps to achieve and maintains that **consistent effort over time** leads to significant transformation.
