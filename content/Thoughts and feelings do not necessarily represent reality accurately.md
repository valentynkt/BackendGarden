This seems like an obvious idea, but I think it should be explicit, especially when it comes to *thoughts in the context of emotions*.

Our emotional state [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|plays a very big role]] in the feelings and thoughts we have. Since our [[Emotions are irrational|emotions are irrational]], we can have thoughts and feelings that feel very true to us — true to our core — yet be inaccurate.

When experiencing strong emotions (such as those that accompany [[Stages of Grief|grief]]), it is easy to go down thought spirals that lead to [[202209191047 Hurts Like Hell|dark places]]. While it is very valid to think these thoughts and [[Emotions need to be felt|feel the associated feelings]], it would behoove us realize and keep in mind that the thoughts we have during these emotional states are *necessarily irrational*.

Instead, we should [[Know Thyself#How to get to know yourself|examine our thoughts]] to [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|understand them and ultimately ourselves]]. This will allow us to think rationally to judge our ideas fairly rather than succumbing to [[No rational emotional decision|emotional decision-making]].

Despite emotional thoughts being irrational, it still makes sense to [[No bad thoughts in a Zettelkasten|capture]] and [[What does it mean to process thoughts|process them]]. The thoughts could be weeds that need to eventually be pruned, but we don't know that until we try to integrate the thoughts into our knowledge framework.
