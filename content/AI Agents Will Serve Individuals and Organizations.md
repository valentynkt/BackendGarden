In the near future, AI agents will act on behalf of individual content **consumers**, **creators**, and **newsrooms**.

The key aspect of these agents is *who* they serve - each agent's top priority will be to further the interests of the person or organization it represents.

This means that rather than having a single dominant AI system, there will be a multitude of agents tailored to different needs and goals.
