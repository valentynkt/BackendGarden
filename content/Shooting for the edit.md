This is a technique when filming to plan shots ahead of time to make it easier to edit them later. It's asking the question "how will these shots fit together later?"

They can include a lot of in-camera transitions such as:

* [[Match Cut Transition]]
* [[Whip pan cinematic transition]]
* [[Cinematic Slide Transition]]

A little planning goes a long way.
