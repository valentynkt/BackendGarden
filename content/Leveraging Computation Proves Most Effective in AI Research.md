Historical evidence from 70 years of AI research demonstrates that general methods leveraging computation ultimately prove the most effective by a **significant margin**.

This [[Moore's Law|stems from Moore's Law]], which describes the exponential decrease in computation costs over time.

While researchers often attempt to [[Human Knowledge Hinders Long-Term AI Progress|incorporate human knowledge]] into AI systems for short-term gains, the long-term progress predominantly comes from approaches that leverage computation [[Q-Star Enhances Reasoning Capabilities in AI Models|through search and learning]].
