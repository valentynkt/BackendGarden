1. Accelerate your personal growth. Getting outside of your comfort zone.
2. Leave a legacy
3. Be a maker, not a consumer. The process *feels* good.
4. Build your personal brand and discover who you are.
5. Make an impact. Bring attention to and do something that matters to you. In a way that is meaningful to you.
6. Create a community. Similar interests. Relationships, connections are important. Incredibly important.
