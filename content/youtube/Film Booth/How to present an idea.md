[[Elements for creating a good video]]

He follows his own advice. He presents this idea with a story: a game. It illustrates the idea perfectly.

He presents the idea with his style of humor, with fun special effects, and good visual storytelling.

When he starts the game, he shifts to standing up from sitting down.

It adds to the video as it's a "real-life" example of him coming up with the idea and iterating to find the best way to present it.
