# American Dream is a Lie

The *American Dream* is the idea that the USA is a meritocracy and that anyone regardless of their background or circumstance, if they work hard enough, can "make it."

It's a lie and has never been true.

[[Systemic racism runs deep in America|Systemic racism]] and [[America is late-stage capitalism|late-stage capitalism]] help to keep it that way.
