# Ideas start out fragile and are easily dismissed

You never know where an idea will lead until you actually think about it and try to understand [[Epistemology|where it fits in with your other thoughts]].

Inspired by [Jony Ive](https://mobile.twitter.com/davekopec/status/1378257042088017920):
> "...while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts. So easily missed. So easily compromised. So easily just squished."
