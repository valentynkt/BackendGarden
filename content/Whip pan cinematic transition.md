This is very similar to the [[Cinematic Slide Transition|slide transition]] but with a deliberate jarring camera move.

For instance, when flying with a drone, a quick gimbal rotation down in the first shot cuts to a shot looking down at a similar surface which whips back up to reveal the new shot.

Some useful homogeneous surfaces to do this with:
* grass
* pavement
* water

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure not to make any micro corrections with the joystick (for a drone). This transition works best when both shots are moving forward.

## Blending

Speed-ramping or cross-dissolving the two clips can make the clips blend better.
