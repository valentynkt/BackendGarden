The value in ideas and knowledge come from understanding how they fit together.

[[Ideas are Fragile|Ideas start out as fragile]] and fleeting. They need to be nurtured and connected to other ideas to truly thrive.

The value and insights of ideas come from their connection: the relationship between them. Bridging seemingly disparate ideas and seeing a connection that wasn't previously seen is where insights and creativity come from.

It's the difference between *knowing* something and *understanding* something.

This is very similar to [[Positive social connections keep us healthy|human relationships]] where the value comes from the connection. Applied to your most important relationship (the [[Accept yourself for who you are|relationship to yourself]]), it's the difference between knowing that something "bothers" you and [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|understanding why/how]] and being able to move past it.

Neurons (artificial and natural) also produce value not from themselves, but in the way they are [[Network emergent behavior|connected to other neurons]].

Computers become far more useful when they are networked together.

The [[Art as expression of emotion|fundamental idea of art]] is taking existing things and combining them in new and creative ways where the [[Network emergent behavior|sum is greater than its parts]].

> ...if there’s meaning in links, they’re _implicit_ at best. That applies well into the _series of links_. For them to be useful in the long run, you have to _capture the meaning_ of these thought trails as soon as possible. (i.e. make them _explicit_ — just like how you turn fleeting notes into zettels)

> **The point of note-taking is to think better**. Capturing is a means to it; retention is merely a side effect.
