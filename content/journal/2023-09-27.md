model size vs speed

can an AI think a thought that a human is incapable of thinking?
	laudenfhour limit.
	our brains are quantum computers

more in common between human brains and AI

it's about SPEEEED


we don't have evidence for anything right now
it's all speculation
we still have to make decisions and move forward

SMALLER models more competitive
	faster
	only certain amount of intelligence needed
		especially for our human-level 3D world here

GPT-15 will coordinate smaller models for multiple tasks.
	the same way our brain works. multiple pieces working together
	talk about consciousness experiences

Byzantine Generals Problem
	drone shots of MS river

hyper-competitive settings where machines prioritize speed at expense of performance and accuracy

Humans have to be involved

terminal race condition: death spiral
	first one to flinch loses
	but if nobody flinches, everyone hits the ground and everybody loses

Cybersecurity
	AI immune systems

we are building a global cognitive architecture

speed chess
	you don't have to be smarter and better
	you have to make good-enough moves quickly
	if you are paying attention and can capitalize on mistakes, you can defeat a "better" player

bigger models aren't the future
	small hyper-focused models controlled by larger models
	but, it goes both ways. bad vs good AIs
