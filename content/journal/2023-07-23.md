	- ### Script
		- #### Hook
			- There is a revolution happening in physics right now.
				- clips of mit guy, donald hoffman
			- We're coming up with brand new theories to reconcile the strange nature of quantum physics to general relativity.
			- And from this new understanding of the universe
				- b-roll of "not locally real nobel prize"
			- springs forth the idea that there is a base reality in which time and space don't make sense and from that reality emerges our universe and its laws of physics grounded in space-time.
			-
			- In other words, we live in the matrix.
		- #### Physics History
			- This idea that our world isn't real is called simulation theory and it isn't really anything new.
				- clip of elon musk talking about "base reality"
			- What *is* new and exciting is the discovery of geometric structures that reside outside of our ideas of space and time.
			-
			- But to really appreciate what this all means, you need to understand how we got here.
			-
			- It all started with Newton.
				- animation of apple falling on head
			- He came up with mathematical formulas that described our everyday world giving rise to Newtonian Physics.
			- That worked out really great for a while.
			- Until we started peering into the vast universe in which we reside.
			- That's when we realized we don't really know shit about how any of this works.
			- But luckily, a patent clerk in Germany was bored one day and started thinking.
			- He came up with the idea of the theory of general relativity.
			- This idea says that space and time are fundamentally linked through gravity.
			- And in 1919, Albert Einstein's theories were proven when we discovered gravitational lensing.
			-
			- And that worked out great, for a little while.
			-
			- Until we started peering
			- our universe of space and time is nothing more than an illusion our brains create to help us survive in a world driven by natural selection.
			- Let me explain.

		- The Matrix, a 1999 science fiction film directed by the Wachowski siblings, has been widely recognized for its profound philosophical implications. The film presents a dystopian future where reality, as perceived by most humans, is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix," created by sentient machines to subdue the human population. The philosophy of escaping the Matrix can be seen as a metaphor for the human quest for knowledge, self-awareness, and liberation. This essay will explore the philosophical concepts embedded in the film, focusing on the themes of illusion versus reality, free will versus determinism, and the nature of knowledge.
		- Illusion Versus Reality
		- The Matrix presents a world where the perceived reality is an illusion, a computer-generated dream world designed to keep humans under control. This concept parallels the philosophical idea of solipsism, which posits that one can only be sure of their own mind's existence, and everything outside could be an illusion. The film also draws heavily from Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where prisoners mistake shadows on a wall for reality. In the Matrix, humans are trapped in a similar illusion, believing the simulated reality to be the real world.
		- The protagonist, Neo, is offered a choice between a red pill, symbolizing an acceptance of truth and escape from the Matrix, and a blue pill, representing a return to blissful ignorance. This choice reflects the philosophical dilemma between confronting harsh reality and choosing comfortable illusions. The philosophy of escaping the Matrix, in this context, is a call to challenge and question our perceived reality, urging us to differentiate between illusion and truth.
		- Free Will Versus Determinism
		- The Matrix also grapples with the philosophical debate of free will versus determinism. The characters in the Matrix are bound by its rules and codes, suggesting a deterministic universe where everything is preordained. However, Neo's journey to become "The One" symbolizes the power of free will and the ability to transcend the system's constraints.
		- The Oracle, a program within the Matrix that seems to predict the future, further complicates this theme. Her predictions could be seen as deterministic, but they often act as self-fulfilling prophecies, implying that individuals still have agency in shaping their destinies. The philosophy of escaping the Matrix, in this sense, is about asserting one's free will and breaking free from deterministic structures.
		- The Nature of Knowledge
		- The Matrix also delves into epistemology, the study of knowledge and justified belief. In the Matrix, knowledge is not obtained through traditional means but is directly uploaded into the mind. This method challenges our conventional understanding of learning and knowledge acquisition.
		- The film also questions what constitutes real knowledge. Is knowledge based on sensory experiences valid when those senses can be deceived, as they are in the Matrix? This dilemma mirrors Descartes' dream argument, which questions the reliability of our senses and the certainty of our knowledge. Escaping the Matrix, philosophically, involves seeking true knowledge beyond sensory experiences and questioning the nature of knowledge itself.
		- Conclusion
		- The Matrix serves as a rich philosophical text, exploring profound questions about reality, free will, and knowledge. The philosophy of escaping the Matrix is a metaphor for the human quest for self-awareness, truth, and liberation. It urges us to question our perceived reality, assert our free will, and seek true knowledge. In a world increasingly dominated by technology and simulated experiences, these philosophical inquiries become even more relevant, reminding us to remain critical of our realities and the knowledge we acquire.
