	- I like this editing style
		- or do I?
			- this feels like it is what I'm striving for. like the perfect video I'm trying to create. and it falls flat for me. so flat.
			- maybe this is my wake-up call to understand that is not the type of video I should create.
			- the idea of just delivering a ChatGPT script well and relying on editing and delivery but soulless content
			- I need to differentiate #[[Mindful Machines]] by harnessing the power of storytelling.
				- not relying on good delivery of mediocre content
	- I want to remake this video but as a story and with me as b-roll
	- something about his delivery puts me off
		- so robotic. and perfect.
		- the staccato hand movements and intense air grips makes me feel like I cannot trust him
			- he is air-choking a few times
		- it feels like he is reading word-for-word a ChatGPT script
	- he seems like a sleazy marketer to me

	- {{youtube-timestamp 904}} *we get into a really dark place when we don't know what we can believe*
		- he sounds like me?
	-
- that deep dark place that you can never confront
	- why not?
