- Art is now about creating "art pipelines"
	- You draw a character in a certain number of poses.
		- You train a model on that character and that style.
			- There is now an intelligence that will create art at your direction and in your style.
		- Your "consciousness" - the part of the process you pay attention to - rises. Now you are free to focus on the more important aspects of your project.
			- And the beauty is you can focus in on whatever part of that process that you find meaning in.
				- AI with art unlocks humanity's abundant creativity.
					- That's what the world needs. Access to the **resources of creation**.
- Code Llama is only 34B tokens, orders of magnitude less parameters than GPT-3.5 and still beats it.
