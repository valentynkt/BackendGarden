- ## YouTube Script [[Prompting]]
	- You are an expert screenwriter. I am going to give you a video script for a YouTube video to critique. Once I provide the script, please provide constructive criticism to improve flow, accuracy, and understandability.
	  
	  I will send you the script in parts. After I send each part, only respond with "gots it"
	  
	  Only respond with your script critique once I indicate I have given you the whole script.
	  
	  Respond with "Beer me a script!" if you understand.
