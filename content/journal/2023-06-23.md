			- AI Alignment, even if you disagree with the core ideas. If you think
				- we are far away from superintelligent AI
					- we're not. we're closer than you may think.
				- or that superintelligent AI would automatically know or infer human values
					- it is far more probable, in fact a near certainty, that they wouldn't. it would treat us the way we treat ants
				- it is *still* an existential threat
					- putin meddled with our elections
						- AI makes that ability unprecedented
						- Putin is threatening TRUST

						- that we had evolved past world wars and large conflicts which required a "stiff upper lip"
