	- ### Outline
		- **Dead Internet Theory**
		- **The Unsettling Moves of Big Internet Companies**
			- **Charging for API Access**
				- Discuss Twitter's decision to charge $40k to third-party developers for access to its API and data, and Reddit's consideration of a similar move.
			- **The Importance of Openness**
				- Briefly touch on the tech industry's traditional emphasis on openness and how these recent moves seem to contradict that.
			- **Data is Money**
				- Discuss how data has become a valuable commodity, not just for advertising, but also for training AI systems. You might want to hint at the ethical implications of this.
				- Data is money. But it's not just about advertising anymore. Our personal data is being used in ways we might never have imagined. It's being used to train AI systems, and in some cases, these systems are being designed to replace human roles. But at what cost? As we delve into this topic, we'll explore the ethical implications of using our data in this way.
			- **The Downfall of Big Tech?**
				- Pose the question of why these moves could potentially lead to the downfall of these companies. This will set the stage for the detailed discussion in the following sections.
			- **The AI Connection**
				- Tease the connection between these issues and AI, using a b-roll of the model collapse paper to pique viewers' interest.
			- **The Threat to the Internet**
				- End the section by posing the question of how these issues could potentially destroy the internet. This will provide a smooth transition into the "The Flood of Big Data" section.
		- **The Flood of Big Data**
			- **Rise of Automated Channels**
				- Discuss the rise of automated, faceless YouTube channels. Explore how this trend impacts the diversity and authenticity of content on the platform.
			- **AI and Content Creation**
				- Discuss how content writers are being replaced due to the rise of blogs and news articles increasingly written by AI. Explore the implications of this trend on the quality of content and the job market.
			- **Implications of AI-Generated Content**
				- Briefly touch on the broader implications of AI-generated content. How does it affect the quality and diversity of information available on the internet? What are the potential risks and benefits?
		- **Lockdown**
			- **API Access Fees**
				- Discuss Twitter's sudden move to charge exorbitant fees for API/data access. Explore the implications of this decision on third-party developers and the broader tech ecosystem.
				- Discuss Reddit's consideration of charging for API/data access and the backlash from its user community. Explore the potential implications of such a move on Reddit's platform and its users.
			- **The Importance of Datasets**
				- Talk about the importance of datasets in training AI models. Discuss how access to data can influence the development and effectiveness of AI systems.
		- **Death of Search**
			- **Generative AI Responses**
				- Discuss the potential implications of Google and Bing's move towards generative AI responses in search, which are often seen as incorrect or plagiarized. Explore the impact of this on the reliability and trustworthiness of search results.
			- **The Effect on Content Quality**
				- Talk about the negative effects of this trend, such as the proliferation of uninspired content that people now have to sift through to find what they really want. Discuss how this could lead to information overload and decrease the overall quality of content on the internet.
			- **Trust in Information**
				- Discuss the impact of these changes on users' trust in information. Can users trust information anymore when it's increasingly generated by AI? Explore the potential long-term implications of this for our relationship with information and knowledge.
			- **Potential Solutions**
				- Discuss potential solutions or alternatives to the current state of search. This could include improvements in AI technology, better regulation, or new search models that prioritize quality and reliability.
		- **Model Collapse**
			- The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget
				- The authors find that using model-generated content for training can lead to irreversible defects in the resulting models. Specifically, they observe that the tails of the original content distribution disappear, a phenomenon they refer to as "Model Collapse".
					- not just limited to LLMs
				- Model collapse means more bias, less creativity, and more distrust of AI models
				- They conclude that the value of data collected from genuine human interactions will become increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.
		- **100% Pure Pasture-Raised Human Data**
			- **The Rise of AI and Human Data**
				- Discuss the rise of AI and the importance of human data in training AI models. Highlight the difference that parameters and training data make in the output of these models.
			- **Quality of Data**
				- Show examples of good vs bad AI outputs, emphasizing the role of quality data in generating useful results.
			- **The Demand for Pure Human Data**
				- Discuss the increasing demand for "pure human data" as AI becomes more prevalent. Explore the implications of this trend on the information economy and the products and services we use.
			- **The Gatekeepers of Information**
				- Discuss how companies that want to be the gatekeepers of information are increasingly trying to segment "human" data from "AI" data. Explore the effects of this on the incentives built into these products and services.
		- **Resisting Moloch**
			- tragedy of the commons
			- Discuss the ethical implications of using human data for AI training. Consider issues such as privacy, consent, and the potential for bias in AI models due to the nature of the data they're trained on.
			- this will lead to the further siloing of people, content, and data as every company clutches the value they think they have left as the entire economy turns over
			- what if we removed the perverse incentives and made data free? effectively making intelligence free?
				- open source
				- web3 decentralization
				- tease the detriments to openness for the next section
		- **Trust in a World Where Nothing Can Be Trusted**
			- **The Need for Transparency**
				- Discuss the importance of transparency in AI systems. How does knowing if something is AI-generated affect our trust? Reference the congressional clip suggesting that people should know if something is AI-generated.
			- **Human Verification**
				- Discuss why verifying human involvement will become increasingly important in an AI-dominated world.
					- public/private key cryptography
				- Technical Solutions
					- AI Watermarking
					- Detecting LLM Output
					- Limitations of these techniques
			- **Building Trust**
				- Building trust also means recognizing the enormous power of what we are building together and how.
					- ironically, that might mean making some things less open while paradoxically still trying to build trust with other players.
					- worldwide "manhattan project" for AI safety/development
				- Conclude by discussing strategies for building and maintaining trust in AI. This could include transparency in AI training and decision-making processes, robust regulation, and public engagement in AI governance.
				- Alignment and human values
					- Discuss the concept of AI alignment, the process of ensuring AI systems' goals are aligned with human values. Explore its importance in building trust and ensuring the safe and beneficial use of AI.
