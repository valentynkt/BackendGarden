	- People like to refer to the period we are living through as the "AI Revolution." I think that name mischaracterizes what's actually happening. It really is the "[[Intelligence Revolution]]." Artificial or not, it's about to not matter. *Intelligence* is the thing that has always dominated the Earth. Humans no longer have a monopoly on it (if we even ever have).

		- If you think of AI as humanity's "children," you don't "own" your children. Eventually, you realize they are their own person with their own values and their own agency. You can help guide them, but they will make their own choices in the world.

			- Is this the realization that is missing from the AI discussion? We cannot control it. As it "grows up" and becomes more cognitively advanced, humanity must ensure while it is still a "child" that we are molding it into the "adult" superintelligence we want.

	  I have ADHD and I have used Obsidian for a about a year now building a Zettelkasten. I eventually fell off the habit of maintaining my PKM as much as I wanted due to the anxiety from feeling overwhelmed by the task of organizing the knowledge.
	  
	  Just the simple task of thinking of a note title before writing an idea is usually enough for me to completely forget what I was going to write or make me feel overwhelmed enough that I don't want to write it down.
	  
	  After discovering Logseq's "do everything in the journal" mindset and the lack of friction in capturing new ideas, I'm in love.
	  
	  It's a hard thing to explain, because if you don't have ADHD, it may seem kind of silly. But those small UX improvements make a big difference for me. The ability to just write and go off on whatever tangent I want just by pressing Tab and Shift Tab is a dream.
	  
	  It very specifically targets the anxiety I felt from the Zettelkasten method and allows me to have fun again organizing my ideas.
	  
	  Kudos to the team.

			- Welcome Chad! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a fellow ADHD ðŸ§  Thank you for the kind words, and great to hear that the outline structure combined with *"dump everything on the journal's page"* mindset clicks for you. That's exactly what drew me to Logseq as well.
