# Stephen Wolfram: Mystery of Entropy Solved

		- {{youtube-timestamp 256}} LLM Science & Temperature
			- Temperature 0 means the LLM picks the word most likely (statistically) to come next.
			- Temperature 1 means the LLM picks on its own.
			- As you "crank the temperature" - ChatGPT with a 1.2 critical temperature is a phase transition from sense to nonsense.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 404}} What is entropy?
			- Entropy is counting the states of a system that are consistent with what you know about that system.
			- Second Law of Thermodynamics: the universe always moves from "special" configurations to "typical" configurations.
			- {{youtube-timestamp 882}} All of our laws of physics are reversible yet the behavior we observe in the universe is manifestly irreversible.
				- {{youtube-timestamp 991}} Entropy as related to encryption
					- We can't understand how to reverse it if we can't "decrypt" it. It looks "random" to us.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1036}} Brains compute based on enormous amount of detail and the course-grained thought emerges from the computational processing.
			- Is this process reversible? Can we think a thought and have it manifest into the lower levels of reality to make the thought appear in our physical understanding of the world?
				- Yes, I think so. I think this is the converse of the *Law of One*.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1157}} Computational Irreducibility: **Science cannot give you all the answers**.

			- {{youtube-timestamp 1185}} **AI alignment is impossible**.
				- To know what it's going to do, you have to run it and see what it does. It is the only way to know.
					- We, as consciousness, are the process of observing the computation of energy in motion.

		- {{youtube-timestamp 1270}} The key result of statistical mechanics is the second law of thermodynamics.

- The way we write software will change.
	- higher-order components.
		- we will build components, modules, applications, and networks from APIs that understand natural language (LLMs)
			- every one of those layers has emerging capabilities and new abstractions and ways of thinking and reasoning about the world
				- this applies to all forms of computational processing machinery with sensory inputs
				- in other words: every part of the universe has some level of conscious, however miniscule or literally all-encompassing it may be
	- where do humans still fit in the loop?
		- deciding what to do. processing the emotions to know *what* to build.
		- because we are reality creators. we can build anything we want.
			- the ultimate question is: **what do you want?**

- # Rejection Sensitivity Disorder
	- When other people reject us, they are rejecting the parts of themselves they see in us.
		- And that isn't unhealthy. People's ideas aren't always compatible in the ways necessary for whatever context the rejection took place in.
			- Everyone needs to do what is right for themselves as we are each on our own path.
				- But we all end up at the same place.
		- If they are not aware of their reasons for rejection and instead are rejecting to avoid feeling an emotion themselves,
			- they tend to fling those emotions around as anger or resentment - low energy states
			- when on the receiving end of those strong negative emotions, it is extremely painful
				- Feeling the rejection is definitely hard. But feeling it is necessary for that energy to move on and dissipate.
					- The emotion is "energy in motion" and time and space only exist to allow the *subjective* experience to be computed into that which can be *objectively known*.
						- ((64e766fc-84b0-45d2-b70c-8fd9ae8df7af))
				- Avoiding feeling the pain of rejection and instead deflecting, defending, and hurling anger and resentment back towards the other,
					- this causes the negative energy to build up and spread like a virus
					- the energy has to be computed
						- it has to follow the second law of thermodynamics and move from a low energy state to a high energy state
				- eventually, all energy will be computed and the universe will be finished with time and space.
					- time and space don't actually exist other than as a construct for our minds to experience the computation
			- moving past the fear of the rejection, putting yourself out there to feel those feelings of rejection remove that little bit of negative energy from the world
