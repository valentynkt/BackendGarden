		- {{youtube-timestamp 37}} Geoffrey Hinton's credentials
id:: 6457ce10-a288-4e2d-8696-909295e99b41
			- Professor Emeritus at University of Toronto
			- Until last week, an engineering fellow at Google
			- pioneer in deep learning, developing some of the most fundamental techniques that underpin AI as we know it today
				- back propagation
			- He received the Turing Award in 2018, often referred to as the nobel prize of computer science.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 166}} computer models use back propagation: probably a better model for intelligence than humans do
		- {{youtube-timestamp 260}} Back propagation explanation
		  id:: 6457cf6d-d903-44bb-85e6-fa1387ada3db
		- {{youtube-timestamp 599}} What is possible with ML/back propagation?
			- language models have all the knowledge of the internet
			- they have a trillion connections between nodes/neurons
				- we have 100 trillion
			- the back propagation algorithm is way more efficient at storing information than our naturally selected brains (the algorithm that gave us our intelligence)

		- {{youtube-timestamp 775}} doctor metaphor for ML intelligence
		  id:: 6457d1f4-6fd8-4627-afbb-92d0bbe0d289
		- {{youtube-timestamp 834}} GPT-4 can do reasoning
		  id:: 6457d27b-b08d-4898-85d3-dea24570bfdf
			- {{youtube-timestamp 892}} IQ of 80/90
			  id:: 6457d2ae-2d4a-4c05-b652-3ee396cfe3fa
		- {{youtube-timestamp 941}} AI will manipulate people
			- {{youtube-timestamp 974}} if you can manipulate people, you don't have to directly pull levers
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1058}} this is not climate change. there is no readily apparent solution
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1077}} we can't stop development
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1097}} we live in a world with bad actors where people want to build robot soldiers to kill people
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1114}} it's not clear there is a solution

			- {{youtube-timestamp 1160}} smart things will outsmart us. two-year old metaphor
			  id:: 6457d46c-4e5f-48bd-84cc-effc960c77cd
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1193}} evolution vs machine learning
		  id:: 6457d4a4-9a97-46ba-b843-cdf5318b7eea
			- built-in goals that are hard for us to turn off
				- pain, hunger, reproduction
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1227}} it's important that we can't turn it off
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1300}} humanity is just a passing phase in evolutionary intelligence
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1344}} we figured out immortality
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1373}} it's a bad idea for old white men to be immortal
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1451}} we should stop, but we can't

		- {{youtube-timestamp 1515}} tragedy of the commons. capitalism/competition will kill us
		  id:: 6457d614-dc01-46e8-b834-2f74ce4a115e
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1595}} distinct forms of intelligence: digital vs human
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1816}} thought experiments and reasoning in AI
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1914}} training with inconsistent beliefs leads to inconsistent reasoning
		- {{youtube-timestamp 2031}} moving goal posts for AI capabilities
		- {{youtube-timestamp 2084}} Hinton predicts the next 5 years
			- {{youtube-timestamp 2132}} income inequality leads to violence
