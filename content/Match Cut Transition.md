Keep the subject the same in each shot and change setting/background. It keeps the viewers eyes anchored and makes for more "cinematic" cuts. It can make a hard cut feel more seamless.

## Tips for a good shot

### Gridlines

Make sure to turn gridlines on and keep your subject at the same sice/location within each shot. It helps to follow the [[rule of thirds]] while doing this.

### Use title overlay in editing

Some minor editing needs to be done to keep the subject exactly in the same spot for each clip. Use the "title overlay" trick to accomplish this.
