A [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share **seeds of thoughts** to be **cultivated in public**. Instead of polished articles displayed in reverse chronological order like a blog, a digital garden is more like a free form, work-in-progress wiki.

## Relations to Zettelkasten

There are different categories of notes in both [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and digital gardening that can roughly translate to each other.

Digital gardening tends to be a superset of Zettelkasten ideas but more geared for public consumption rather than [[Separate Idea Intake from Idea Judgment|strictly a private endeavor]].

> The *garden* term represents the idea of notes which are constantly tended and exist in various stages of development.

I stole ideas from both, put them in the idea blender, and came up with a bag of mixed metaphors for [[Why Zettelkasten|my Zettelkasten]] that I really like.

## Idea Journey

🍃 I use the daily note in `journal/` for fleeting ideas that get tagged `#daily`. These ideas [[Fleeting Ideas Shouldn't Hang Around|come and go quick]] so it's important to have a quick way to capture the idea. I use a voice recorder when not in front of a PC.

🌱 The next stage of an idea is germinating it to a `#seedling` where it graduates to the root folder as an individual idea linked to from the original journal entry. This is where thoughtgasms turn into legible, coherent, atomic ideas.

Tending to a seedling involves [[Ideas and knowledge on their own are not useful|connecting the idea]] with other ideas within my knowledge base in order to gain understanding of the idea and how it fits in with what I already know. This process also involves *tending* to various other `#evergreen` notes I find along the way:

* fix a link here,
* fix some formatting there,
* reexamine if the idea still makes sense
* or if it leads me to another thought tangent
	* connecting infinite ideas together in infinite ways... 🤯

🌲 Once an idea feels more fleshed out, it graduates to `#evergreen`. These notes I feel like are reasonably well thought-out ideas that I intend to keep around. But all ideas can be changed, merged, or deleted.
