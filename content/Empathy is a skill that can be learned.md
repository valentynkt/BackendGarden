# Empathy is a skill that can be learned

[[Empathy Sympathy and Compassion|Empathy]] is a skill that can be practiced just as there are [[Journaling is an effective way to process our emotions|practices we can use to understand our own emotions]].

The skill can be practiced by:
- listen to the **verbal** and **non-verbal** messages from others
	- body movements
	- gestures
	- physical signs
- use questions to probe feelings rather than just surface-level who/what/when/where
	- ask for feedback that you correctly understood their feelings
- **acknowledge** and **respect** the feelings of others even if you disagree
	- avoid making comments that are *judgmental*, *belittling*, *rejecting*, or *undermining*

Practicing this skill necessarily leads to [[Emotional Intelligence is our understanding of others|higher emotional intelligence]] and a [[Empathy builds relationships|deeper relationship with others]].
