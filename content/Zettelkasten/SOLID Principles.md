# SOLID Principles

## Overview

![[Pasted image 20240419030031.png]]
  
The SOLID principles are like a set of rules for software developers. They help make sure that the programs they create are easy to work with, can grow without too much trouble, and are clear to understand.

>[!abstract] 
>Think of SOLID as a toolbox for building software. These principles are the foundation for creating strong and reliable systems in object-oriented programming.

### Key Concepts

Each SOLID principle focuses on a different aspect of how to design software, working together to create a codebase that's organized and adaptable:

> [!important]
> 
> - **[[Single Responsibility Principle|SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)]]**: This says that each class should do just one job.
> - **[[Open Closed Principle|OCP (Open Closed Principle)]]**: It suggests designing modules in a way that you can add new features without changing the existing code.
> - **[[Liskov Substitution Principle|LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)]]** :It ensures that you can use a subclass wherever you would use the superclass without breaking the program.
> - **[[Interface Segregation Principle|ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)]]**: This principle encourages having specific interfaces for each client rather than one big interface for everyone.
> - **[[Dependency Inversion Principle|DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)]]**: It advises relying on abstract concepts rather than specific implementations.

## Summary

>[!summary] 
>The SOLID principles are essential in object-oriented design, providing a blueprint for building software that can withstand changes and be iterated upon easily. They act as a roadmap for crafting systems that are simpler to debug, test, and maintain, embodying the fundamental principles of successful software development.
