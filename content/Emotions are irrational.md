# Emotions are irrational by definition

Since emotions are [[Limbic System Controls Emotion|controlled by the limbic system]], the prefrontal cortex (our rational brain) never gets involved before an [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|emotional reaction]] occurs.

It necessarily follows that [[No rational emotional decision|emotional decisions]] and [[Thoughts and feelings do not necessarily represent reality accurately|emotional thoughts]] are inherently irrational.

> It is important to know that emotions are considered to be irrational, illogical and unreasonable since they are carried out by the limbic system, which is separate from the neocortex, which deals with reasoning, conscious thoughts, and decision making.
