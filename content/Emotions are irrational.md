Since emotions are [[Limbic System Governs Emotion|controlled by the limbic system]], the prefrontal cortex (our rational brain) never gets involved before an emotional reaction occurs.

This makes sense since these [[Cognitive Biases Evolved as Survival Mechanisms|emotional responses originally evolved as a survival mechanism]].

It necessarily follows that the [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|thoughts that accompany an emotional reaction]] are *inherently* irrational.
