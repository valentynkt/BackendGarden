## Objective

Give people an easy way to run AutoGen. Highlight a use-case.

architecture is where the innovation is happening now
not about larger models, combining smaller models in intelligent ways, whether designed by a human or an AI

## Packaging

Master this One Simple Technique for AI Mastery

## Outline

Welcome to this live AI workshop.

Let me tell you a little bit about what to expect today.

### Hook

I was talking to a friend the other day, and this is something I hear a lot. People are starting to realize the power of these AI tools available to us and they want to use it for themselves but don't really know where to start.

And I talk to other people who use AI tools everyday but are starting to hit the limits of what they can do with basic prompt engineering.

So, what I'm going to show you today is the easiest way that I've found to address these issues.

And to showcase exactly how to do this, we're going to build a research bot together.

And if you want to follow along, there is a link in the description below. Now, this is a link to a code repository. I know a lot of you are software engineers watching this, but you don't need to be to follow along here.

Programming is quickly becoming less about code and more about psychology. And I'll show you what I mean by that in a bit.

But first thing's first.

### How

The basic idea we are going to implement is the idea that "we can accomplish more by working together than separately." It's something that's true for humans and for AI too.

And this concept has started to pop up everywhere with projects like

ChatDev
https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev

GPTEngineer
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer

Today, though, we are going to use AutoGen.
https://github.com/microsoft/autogen

AutoGen is a framework that makes it almost trivial to create organizations of AIs that can work together. It has a lot of advantages built-in.
