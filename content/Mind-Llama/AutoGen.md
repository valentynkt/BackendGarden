The rapidly expanding idea of prompt engineering is now giving way to Prompt Orchestration.

Up until recently, your ability to get something useful out of a large language model largely depended on your ability to prompt it: prompt engineering.

After prompt engineering, you can optimize your results by crafting series of prompts going back and forth with the model treating it as a collaborator. This feedback loop helps immensely for the model to understand what you actually want and is really just an effective way to communicate in general.

But Microsoft wants you to think even bigger - Prompt Orchestration.

AutoGen allows you to easily create multi-agent applications that can be hyper-optimized for specific tasks.

This applies to software engineers and non-technical people too, because the way these things are programmed now, it's largely with just uh, ya know ... *human* words.

I'm going to dive into
