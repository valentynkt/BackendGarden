The ability to effective prompt a large language model mostly comes down to your ability to communicate what you actually want - not so different from talking with humans.



GPT-4 can do a lot of amazing things if it's prompted properly: something called prompt engineering. But multi-agent models take this idea to a whole new level to the point where all you are doing as a human is directing an organization: prompt orchestration.

Up unto this point, your ability to use AI has mostly been limited by your ability to engineer your prompts. Microsoft AutoGen 

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the way we communicate with machines has always been pivotal. With GPT-4, we witnessed the astonishing capabilities that arose from precise prompt engineering, turning simple questions into profound insights. But now, as we venture into the world of multi-agent models, we're not just engineering prompts; we're orchestrating them. Imagine not merely interacting with a single entity but directing an entire symphony of AI agents, where your role as a human transcends coding and delves into the art of prompt orchestration. Welcome to the next frontier of human-AI collaboration.
