ADHD people find motivation in things that are stimulating and engaging to their brains. Things that are:

* urgent,
* new or novel
* personally interesting

**This need for stimulation is not a choice**. It's the only way for an ADHD brain to "work" since [[Finding motivation for someone with ADHD can be very difficult|it can't otherwise connect the dopamine brain reward with an action]].

Other coping mechanisms, such as [[ADHD Stimulant Medication|stimulant medication]] and [[Excercise for ADHD motivation issues|exercise]] can help people with ADHD-based motivational issues.
