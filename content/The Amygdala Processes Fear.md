The amygdala, a key component of the [[Limbic System Governs Emotion|limbic system]], is particularly important in processing *fear* and *threat-related* stimuli.

When the amygdala detects a potential threat, it can trigger a rapid, automatic response, such as the **"fight, flight, or freeze"** reaction.

This response is often accompanied by the activation of [[Cognitive Biases Evolved as Survival Mechanisms|cognitive biases]], such as the [[Negativity Bias Amplifies the Impact of Bad News|negativity bias]], which prioritizes negative information over positive information.

The amygdala's sensitivity to threat can lead to the **overestimation of risk** and the **underestimation of potential rewards**, [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|affecting our decision-making processes]].
