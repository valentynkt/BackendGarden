[Shifting Our Perceptions to Shape Our Reality]()
By [[people/Mind Coach]]

The email discusses shifting perceptions to shape our reality and empowering ourselves through positive thinking. It emphasizes the importance of crafting narratives that serve us better and encourage a more enjoyable experience. The author invites readers to join the Turbo Think Tank group program and offers consultations to help manage a turbo-charged brain.

### Highlights
> We can craft our perception of reality through language and conversation. Our conversation partner reflects our thoughts back to us bringing new perspectives and together we can collaboratively edit the story. We can make it a story that better serves us and our world.. The better we *perceive* a reality that serves us and those around us, the more we can enjoy the experience.
