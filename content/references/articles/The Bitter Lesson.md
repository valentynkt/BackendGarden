[The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)
By [[people/incompleteideas.net]]

The key lesson from 70 years of AI research is that leveraging computation through general methods is the most effective approach. Many AI researchers initially focused on human knowledge, but the true progress comes from scaling computation through search and learning techniques. Embracing the power of general-purpose methods over human-centric approaches is crucial for long-term success in AI research.

### Highlights
> The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

> We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.
