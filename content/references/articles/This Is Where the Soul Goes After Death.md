[This Is Where the Soul Goes After Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHS3s5D4F3M)
By [[people/The Alchemist]]

The text discusses the concept of the tunnel of light experienced during passing. It explores different forms of light representing various levels of consciousness and the idea of reincarnation. It emphasizes the importance of awakening and detachment from the physical realm to navigate the afterlife effectively. The text also touches on spiritual themes like attachment and ego identification.

### Highlights
> Illusion means it's made of light ancient spiritual teachings were never using the term illusion to mean that something wasn't real ancient spiritual teachings were using the term illusion to describe the state of our Consciousness when we are completely unawakened when we are completely asleep
