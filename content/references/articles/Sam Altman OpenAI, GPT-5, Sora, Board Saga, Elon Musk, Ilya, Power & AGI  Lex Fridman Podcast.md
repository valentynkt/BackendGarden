[Sam Altman: OpenAI, GPT-5, Sora, Board Saga, Elon Musk, Ilya, Power & AGI | Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqFAi7vkBc)
By [[people/Lex Fridman]]

Sam Altman discusses the importance of compute power in the future and the potential for systems to reach remarkable capabilities by the end of the decade. He reflects on the tumultuous experience of the OpenAI board saga, highlighting both the negative aspects and the support he received. Altman emphasizes the need for resilience and structured governance to navigate the challenges of building towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The conversation delves into the dynamics of board structures, power struggles, and the selection process for board members with diverse expertise required for impactful decision-making in the future.

### Highlights
> she did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos but but people often see leaders in the moment in like the crisis moments good or bad um but a thing I really value and leaders is how people act on a boring
> Tuesday at 9:46 in the morning and in in just sort of the the the normal drudgery of the day-to-day how someone shows up in a meeting the quality of the decisions they make that was what I meant about the Quiet Moments meaning like most of the work is done on a day by day in the meeting by meeting just just be present and and make great decisions

watch his body language here. he starts to smile. he blinks profusely, looks around and then stares off to the right as if he's envisioning something.

when asked if is "feeling good about...", he quickly and very directly responds "yes" while Lex is still talking. this is coming off that emotional moment he just had about Ilya. compare his body language.
 I don't think he is feeling good. combine that with the interview he did Arab Emirates where he scratches his nose when asked about he's feeling about the future with AGI.

he looks almost directly up into the light. envisioning what he wants the future to look like

he describes how it "thinks differently" from how humans do.
 then adds a "and whatever"
 "it will get better with scale"
 - compare to MLST podcast where he says he is "a scaling guy"
 - he makes eye contact but then quickly looks down to his right on that line

> the way I think about it is not what percent of jobs AI will do but what percent of tasks will AI do and over what time Horizon so if you think of all of the like five second tasks in the economy five minute tasks the five hour tasks maybe even the five day tasks how many of those can AI do and I think
> that's a way more interesting impactful important question than how many jobs AI can do because it is a tool that will work at increasing levels of sophistication and over longer and longer time Horizons for more and more tasks and let people operate at a higher level of abstraction so maybe people are way more efficient at the job they do and at some point that's not just a quantitative change but that's a qualitative one too about the kinds of problems you can keep in your head

> do we need a way to do a slower kind of thinking where the answer doesn't have to get like you know it's like like I guess like spiritually you could say that you want an AI to be able to think harder about a harder problem and answer more quickly about an easier problem

> part of the reason that we deploy the way we do is that we think um we call it iterative deployment we uh rather than
> go build in secret until we got all the way to GPT 5 we decided to talk about GPT 1 2 3 and 4 and part of the reason there is I think Ai and surprise don't go together and also the world people institutions whatever you want to call it need time to adapt and think about these things and I think one of the best things that open ey has done is this strategy and we we get the world to pay attention to the progress to take AGI seriously

> there are these like very simple sounding but very psychedelic insights that exist sometimes so the square root function square root of four no problem
> square root of two you know okay now I have to like think about this new kind of number um but once I come up with this easy idea of a square root function that you know you can kind of like explain to a child and exists by even like you know looking at some simple geometry then you can ask the question of what is the square root of1 and that this is you know why it's
> like a psychedelic thing that like tips you into some whole other kind of reality and you can come up with lots of other examples but I think this idea that the lowly square root operator can offer such a profound insight and a new realm of knowledge applies in a lot of ways

> you have not had a great deal of genetic drift from your great great great grandparents and yet what you're capable of is
> dramatically different what you know is dramatically different and that is not that's not because of biological change it is because I mean you got a little bit healthier probably you have modern medicine you eat better whatever um but what you have is this scaffolding that we all contributed to built on top of no one person is going to go build the iPhone no one person is going to go discover all of Science and yet you get to use it and that gives you incredible ability and so
> in some sense they like we all created that and that fills me with hope for the future that was a very Collective thing yeah we really are standing on the shoulders of giants
