Based on the information provided in the document "How to Get Comfortable in the Kitchen ft Hannah Hart," the advice for someone with ADHD to get comfortable in the kitchen would involve establishing a basic grocery list of familiar items, particularly focusing on grazer foods that are easy to snack on. The emphasis is on having readily available items like apples, cheese, peanut butter, or tortillas to prevent feeling hungry and overwhelmed when cooking. This approach aims to simplify meal preparation and reduce stress in the kitchen for individuals with ADHD.
