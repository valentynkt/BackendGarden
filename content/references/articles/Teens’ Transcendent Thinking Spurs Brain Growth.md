This form of thinking not only leads to improved brain network coordination over time but also predicts important psychosocial outcomes in young adulthood. This groundbreaking study highlights the significance of promoting civically minded education to support cognitive and emotional development in teenagers, emphasizing the profound effects such thinking can have on brain growth and overall well-being.
