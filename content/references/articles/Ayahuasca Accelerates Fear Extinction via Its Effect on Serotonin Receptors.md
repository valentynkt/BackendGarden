[Ayahuasca Accelerates Fear Extinction via Its Effect on Serotonin Receptors](https://www.psypost.org/ayahuasca-accelerates-fear-extinction-via-its-effect-on-serotonin-receptors/)
By [[people/Eric W. Dolan]]

A study explored how ayahuasca accelerates fear extinction by interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain. Ayahuasca, a traditional psychoactive brew, was found to reduce fear responses in rats by working on both new and old fear memories. The research focused on the compounds in ayahuasca, such as DMT and harmine, that affect serotonin receptors, shedding light on its potential therapeutic benefits in treating anxiety and trauma-related disorders like PTSD. By pinpointing the activation of specific serotonin receptors in the brain as crucial for fear extinction, the study suggests ayahuasca's promise as a tool for developing novel psychiatric treatments.

### Highlights
> Fear memory extinction refers to a psychological process through which the response to a previously learned fear-inducing stimulus decreases over time, typically through repeated exposure to that stimulus without any negative outcomes.
