[The Zettelkasten Method: Examples to Help You Get Started.](https://medium.com/@fairylights_io/the-zettelkasten-method-examples-to-help-you-get-started-8f8a44fa9ae6)
By [[people/Rebecca Williams]]

The Zettelkasten method, popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, involves organizing ideas into atomic notes that can stand alone or be combined to form a cohesive whole. There are five types of notes in this method, including fleeting notes for temporary ideas, literature notes for elaborating on important thoughts, and permanent notes for creating connections across various contexts. Additionally, index notes group related permanent notes, while keyword notes provide entry points to broader areas of interest. The method encourages linking notes to facilitate idea generation and exploration.

Life is a series of patterns. I need to create the pattern of reviewing notes at the end of the day and journaling.
