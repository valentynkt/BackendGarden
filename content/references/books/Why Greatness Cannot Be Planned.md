[Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25670869)
By [[people/Kenneth O. Stanley]] and [[people/Joel Lehman]]

The document "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" delves into the concept that innovation and discovery are often hindered by rigid objectives, emphasizing the importance of novelty and exploration without predefined goals. It discusses how the pursuit of novelty and interesting paths can lead to unexpected breakthroughs, challenging the common belief that progress requires clear objectives. By highlighting the limitations of both objective-driven and non-objective approaches, the document suggests that a balance between the two may be necessary for tackling ambitious challenges and fostering creativity. Ultimately, it advocates for embracing uncertainty and open-minded exploration to unlock new possibilities and avoid stagnation in the quest for innovation.

### Highlights
> There’s an assumption behind these pursuits that isn’t often stated but that few would think to question: We assume that any worthy social accomplishment is best achieved by first setting it as an objective and then pursuing it together with conviction.

> In an interesting experiment by Richard Wiseman [[12](private://read/01hrm8qp2hnwpzsd32pn7pvfph/#CR12)], subjects were asked to count the number of photographs in a newspaper. It turns out that those who focused on the goal of counting the photographs took significantly longer to complete the task than those who were less focused on the objective. Why? The more open-minded participants noticed that on the inside of page two Wiseman had written, “Stop counting: There are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” While some might say that noticing the answer on page two is only luck, the deeper lesson is that focusing too much on your goal can actually prevent you from making useful unexpected discoveries.

> To make this idea more concrete, there’s a great example of this kind of deception called the Chinese finger trap. The trap is a harmless-looking puzzle shaped as an open tube. To begin, you stick your index fingers into each end. But once inserted, your fingers become trapped—and the harder you try to pull them out, the tighter the trap ensnares them. The deception of the Chinese finger trap is that the path to freedom is to push inward, away from freedom. In other words, the stepping stone to freedom is to become less free. This situation illustrates deception well because it shows how wrong it can be to measure progress towards your goal: If your objective is freedom from the Chinese finger trap, then measuring progress by how close you are to freedom is exactly the wrong approach.

> Non-objective search is the true source of much that gives value to our lives. When we unleash search from the trap of the objective, liberating it from the requirement to move only towards where we hope to arrive, it becomes a kind of treasure-hunter that finds needles in the haystack of what’s possible. So then why are so many of our efforts still dominated by the mythical objective? Whatever your goals are, from finding the perfect partner to creating the next great invention, when objectives are ambitious, the only reward you’re likely to receive is deception. That’s what you get for traveling by the false compass.

> And while it might sound wishy-washy to go looking for “interesting” things, interestingness is a surprisingly deep and important concept. In the words of the famous philosopher Alfred Whitehead [[42](private://read/01hrm8qp2hnwpzsd32pn7pvfph/#CR42)]: “It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true.” W.T. Stace [[43](private://read/01hrm8qp2hnwpzsd32pn7pvfph/#CR43)], another philosopher, adds that “the criticism that interestingness is a trivial end proceeds from a scale of values thus perverted and turned upside down.”

> The reality is that we humans have a nose for the interesting. We understand that if we take the interesting path, it may yet lead somewhere important, even though we might not know where. The history of serendipitous discovery supports this idea. If serendipitous discovery was simply accidental, then it wouldn’t take any particular special education or intellect to make such discoveries. For all we know, being a little disorganized or crazy might even be the best way to start.

---

> As you might expect, novelty search leads to one of these different orderings. It doesn’t search from bad to good because without an objective it doesn’t even know what “good” is. Although it might appear that being more novel is “better” than being less novel, it all depends on what you’ve seen so far—someone else with different experiences might come up with exactly the opposite judgment. When rewarding novelty, “better” doesn’t stay “better” over time. The reason is that as soon as a novel behavior is discovered, it quickly becomes less novel as similar behaviors are discovered.

> As Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out in evolution, once all the simple ways to live are exhausted, the only way to create a new species or niche is to become more complex [[48](private://read/01hrm8qp2hnwpzsd32pn7pvfph/#CR48)]. In other words, there are only so many ways of being a bacteria. That’s why increasing complexity is almost inevitable if evolution is to continue. But these increases in complexity are not arbitrary. Rather, they reflect the properties of the world in which evolution takes place: Eyes represent the presence of light in the universe. Ears signify mechanical vibration. Legs are reflections of gravity, and lungs of oxygen.

> So the twist is that the field of AI is itself a search for algorithms, and AI researchers are themselves experts on thinking about searching. In other words, AI researchers are searching for algorithms that search.

> We can think of the gradients followed by AI researchers as the information they use to decide which algorithms are the best. A technical term for a rule of thumb that guides search is a heuristic.

> While no one can be sure which heuristics will work the best for getting to high-level AI, the AI community has settled upon two in particular. The first, which we’ll call the experimentalist heuristic, follows the rule of thumb that an algorithm’s promise is given by how well it performs.

> Besides the experimentalist heuristic, the second main gradient in AI research is the theoretical heuristic. This heuristic suggests that algorithms are better if they can be proven to have desirable properties.

> It would be one thing if criticisms about performance were just criticisms—and not a standard reason for rejection. But because performance is so widely accepted as a filter for new ideas, it becomes a classic deceptive objective function.

> While a theorist might respond that the benefit of the theorem is that any future algorithm that honors the same assumptions will inherit the same guarantees, this fact is not necessarily good news for encouraging the exploration of new ideas. It means that the community becomes restricted only to those algorithms that honor the same growing set of assumptions, blinding the meta-search to every path forward that breaks the assumptions. In the end, the effect is less exploration—the objective paradox takes it hold.

> The algorithms that are remembered, just as with all human inventions, are those that lay the foundation for future trailblazers. They lead to creating new algorithms and perhaps even entirely new fields.

> If we can only think objectively, then we aren’t thinking much at all. There’s no substitute for using our minds because science can’t provide a fixed method to discover the next great idea. The greatest ideas are unlike those that came before them. Every stepping stone has a unique story of discovery. And every human being who found one has a story too.

> In case it’s hard to think of alternatives to arguing about performance or guarantees, there are in fact many other important clues we can consider: inspiration, elegance, potential to provoke further creativity, thought-provoking construction, challenge to the status quo, novelty, analogy to nature, beauty, simplicity, and imagination.
