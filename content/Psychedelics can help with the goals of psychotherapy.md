# Psychedelics can help with the goals of psychotherapy

Psychedelics allow one to think and feel things while not feeling intoxicated. The mechanisms in place that limit our perspective and perception of the world are lifted.

Our brains become more **plastic** and we begin to have an appetite for self-exploration.

The quality of the experience is very dependent on [[Set and setting are very important when taking psychedelics|set and setting]].

The psychedelics **expand our state of consciousness** to allow us to think about things and perhaps confront feelings and emotions that we long ago buried and have been avoiding for many years.

Psychedelics are another tool that when combined with [[Journaling is an effective way to process our emotions|journaling]] and [[Psychotherapy is an effective tool for processing emotions|psychotherapy]] can be very effective at [[What does it mean to process thoughts|processing our emotions]] and [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|discovering ourselves]].
