# People with ADHD are immature

[[ADHD is an executive function disorder|Executive function]] is located in the prefrontal cortex which [doesn't fully develop in adults until around the age of 25](https://youtu.be/H4YIHrEu-TU?t=75). In people with ADHD, this can be delayed by up to 30% and can still be impaired after development.

This can lead to people seeing people with ADHD as undisciplined (rather than suffering from a medical issue) creating a [[202209160906 stigma around medication for mental disorders|societal stigma around treating the disorder]]. This can lead to [[ADHD Self-worth|self-worth issues]].
