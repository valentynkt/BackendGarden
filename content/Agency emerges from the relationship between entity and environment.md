Agency forms as an emergent characteristic from the relationship of dynamic systems and their environment. It very much depends on the entity expanding their conscious field to encapsulate themselves *with* their environment.

Human infants form agency very early in life as a result of realizing their actions affect their environment. It arises from the sudden realization that you are [[Network emergent behavior|part of a larger ecosystem]]. Your actions affect your environment and you can affect change in your external world with conscious thought and action.

This gives rise to self-directed goals and a core agentic drive leading to a system and level of consciousness that is **more than the sum of its parts**.
