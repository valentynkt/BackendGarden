In this state, our minds and bodies are primed to remember and internalize experiences on a **subconscious level**.

This hardwired response is deeply rooted in our evolutionary history, as it helped our ancestors quickly learn and adapt to situations that evoked strong emotions, such as *fear*, *excitement*, or *satisfaction*. [[Cognitive Biases Evolved as Survival Mechanisms|This mechanism is closely tied to the development of cognitive biases]], which also emerged as survival tools.

For this reason, it's *extremely* important to [[Curating a Healthy Media Diet|curate a healthy media diet]] while [[The Opposable Mind Guards Against Cognitive Biases|actively examining ideas]].
