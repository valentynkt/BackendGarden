Given a thought:

- What is the evidence for this thought? Against it?
- Am I basing this thought on facts, or on feelings?
- Is this thought black and white, when reality is more complicated?
- Could I be misinterpreting the evidence? Am I making any assumptions?
- Might other people have different interpretations of this same situation? What are they?
- Am I looking at all the evidence, or just what supports my thought?
- Could my thought be an exaggeration of what's true?
- Am I having this thought out of habit, or do the facts support it?
- Did someone pass this thought / belief to me? If so, are they a reliable source?
- Is my thought a _likely_ scenario, or is it the _worst case_ scenario?
