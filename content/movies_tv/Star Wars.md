*Star Wars*' mysticism borrows heavily from [[Taoism Philosophy|Taoism philosophy and concepts]].

*The Force* with its dark/light side comes from the concept of duality in the Tao. The light and dark *balance* each other.

This [[Taoism Philosophy#Yin and Yang|yin and yang]] inspires the ideas:

- Darth Vader has the seeds of goodness inside of him
- When a powerful good rises, a powerful evil necessarily does as well
	- Anakin (Darth Vader) has a son just as powerful as himself. Luke's light is indivisible from Anakin's darkness.
- The **seeds of each other's opposite** lives within each of them.
	- Anakin finds redemption at the end of *Return of the Jedi*.
	- Luke succumbs to his darkness in *The Last Jedi*.
- Rey rises out of nowhere to match the darkness that arose in Kylo Ren.
- "There are always two: a master and an apprentice"
