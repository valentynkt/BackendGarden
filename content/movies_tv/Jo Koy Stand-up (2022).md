It was very funny. I enjoyed it way more than Patton Oswald (which I tried to watch before this).

He seems **real**, interacting with the audience, having **real emotions**. He goes from [[Laughter is the emotional release of tension#Philosophical Implications|comedy to some real sadness]] and gets teary-eyed at one point in the set.

I especially could relate to his anecdotes with his son and how his ex-wife and him are good co-parents. I felt like it gave me a model and hope that [[Despair and depression come from a lack of imagination|maybe I can find happiness and fulfillment]] if I focus on the right things.
