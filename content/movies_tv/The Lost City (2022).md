# The Lost City (2022)

The movie was mildly amusing.

Typical rom-com of spending time with someone you don't like and realizing they were the ones you were looking for all along... ü§Æ

It feels toxic.

Sandra Bullock is obviously not into Channing Tatum. He is a fucking idiot.

She shouldn't play with his heart. It's not going to work out.

She should have the balls to say "thanks for saving me, but I'm not that into you. Go grow up first."

Brad Pitt being "perfect" and dying in the beginning...pretty funny.
