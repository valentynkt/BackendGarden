# Boys Season 3

allegory for emotional intelligence.

homelander is obviously emotionally stunted. a scared little child with the power of a god.

very interesting dynamic.

the allegory for me:

you can't ignore your emotions.

if you ignore the needs of the child homelander, it grows and festers to the point where it feel like it can't be heard unless it acts out.

it doesn't know how to express its emotions. it tries to control everything and protect its fragile ego until it is literally an existential threat.

you can't snuff it out. the conflict between starlight and butcher/main guy. main guy is also an emotional child. but he has people who care about him -- trying to help him.

butcher knows what he is doing is wrong. it's because he doesn't care about himself. he has such little self-worth that he will sacrifice himself to "make up" for his sins. but he doesn't want to sacrifice who he sees as his little brother. he sees it happening. but he doesn't know how to stop it.

they are the same coin as homelander, just on the opposite side.

the yin and the yang.

starlight and black leader family man are the moral conscience -- the prefrontal cortex trying to keep it together. THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE to accomplish what they want to accomplish. they have to work together as a team and find a way to coexist to kill homelander.

and maybe that's the lesson...they have to coexist. they can't just kill homelander or lock him up. he will come back. they can't.

they need to engage with him. they need to be vulnerable and real with him. it might kill them, but it's the only way.

I'm really interested to see how the last two episodes play out.

it's a great fucking story.
