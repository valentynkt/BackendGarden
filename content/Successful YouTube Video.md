In the end, a "successful" YouTube video is one that I **feel proud** of after making it. However, the platform's version of success and the core metric on which every video is judged is *Views*.

What elements are required in a YouTube video in order for it to be successful on the platform using the platform's definition of success?

1. Title & Thumbnail: get them in the door
2. Hook: tell them what they are going to see
3. Story: this is the thing that gets people to stay for the whole video
4. Value: the viewer should feel like they "got something out of it" at the end
5. Outro: if the viewer watches another video of yours after the current one, you got'em
