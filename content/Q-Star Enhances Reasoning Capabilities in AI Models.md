[[Q-Star Combines Q-Learning and A-Star Search for Efficient Meta-Space Exploration|Q*]] represents OpenAI's effort to enhance reasoning capabilities in AI models, recognizing that language models alone are insufficient for achieving AGI.

By combining large language models, Sora's world simulation capabilities, and Q*, OpenAI aims to create a system capable of complex problem-solving.

The leaked information about Q* suggests the implementation of an energy-based model (EBM) to aid in this process. The EBM acts as a way to judge the compatibility of thought processes produced by the other models in the system, allowing the AI to consider various approaches before converging on the most compatible one.

This internal deliberation mimics human reasoning and enables the model to [[Q-learning Balances Exploration and Exploitation|explore a broader space of possibilities]], leading to [[Achievement Is a Process of Discovery|more creative and insightful outputs]].
