1. **Space**: Don't cram things in to the image.
2. **Color**: Use color to make items stick out or draw someone's eye.
3. **Fonts**: Stick to Sans Serif fonts to play it safe.
4. **Text**: Don't use more than 4 words in an image.
5. **Stock image**: Edit them to work for the thumbnail & avoid cheesy images.
6. **Position**: Choose where you position yourself between the left, the right or the center.
7. **Sizing**: Make sure the items in your image are not too big or too small. Ask yourself "if I have to make something really small, should it even be in the image".
8. **Arrows**: Use arrows to direct people's eyes to the thing you want them to notice.
