Since [[Emotions vs Feelings vs Thoughts|emotional feelings are thoughts]], they can be [[Ideas and knowledge on their own are not useful|connected together for insights]] just like any other idea.

Journaling (in a [[Digital Gardening|Zettelkasten-like way]]) can and should be used to [[What does it mean to process thoughts|process our emotions]]. This can help us [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|understand ourselves and our sense of identity]].

This is especially true if we take the opportunity to [[No bad thoughts in a Zettelkasten|keep the journal private]] (for our eyes only) so we feel safe to share our darkest feelings and thoughts. It is only by [[Thoughts and feelings do not necessarily represent reality accurately|examining them]] that we can [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|understand them and ourselves]] and ultimately [[Accept yourself for who you are|accept and love ourselves]].

Using idea frameworks such as the [[Idea Compass as a Thought Framework|Idea Compass]], we can think about and understand where emotions come from and what they could potentially lead to.

The idea of being able to share your inner thoughts is very similar to the [[Psychotherapy is an effective tool for processing emotions|goals of psychotherapy]].
