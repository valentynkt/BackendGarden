Laughter, at its core, is **based on aggression**. If you replace the [[Laughter is the emotional release of tension|emotional tension that builds during a joke]] with *sympathy* instead of *aggression*, the audience will feel **pity**.

One way to understand this connection is through the concept of **superiority**. Many jokes and humorous situations involve a sense of superiority over someone else, whether it's laughing at their misfortune, mocking their foolishness, or feeling a sense of triumph over an adversary. This type of humor often relies on a build-up of aggressive tension, which is then [[Laughter is the emotional release of tension|released through laughter]].

### Example

The example of a drunk person falling on their face illustrates this point well. If we feel a sense of aggression or hostility towards the drunk person, perhaps because we see their behavior as foolish or irresponsible, then their misfortune may seem funny to us. We may feel a sense of superiority or triumph over them, which is released through laughter.

However, if we replace that aggression with [[Empathy Sympathy and Compassion|sympathy or compassion]], the situation takes on a different tone. Instead of feeling superior, we may feel pity or concern for the drunk person's well-being. The release of tension that comes with laughter is replaced by a sense of [[Empathy builds relationships|sadness or empathy]].

## Positive Aspects

Aggressive humor can serve positive social functions, such as [[Laughter helps bond people together|bonding groups together]] or [[Humor challenges social norms and power structures|challenging power structures]].
