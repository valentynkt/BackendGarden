# Laughter is based on aggression

At its core, the emotional tension that builds up in the audience (whether it's others or ourselves) is **based on aggression**. If you replace the emotional build-up of aggression with sympathy, instead of a release of tension, the audience will feel **pity**.

As an example, imagine in some context that it is funny for a drunk person to fall on his face. If you replace aggression with [[Empathy Sympathy and Compassion|sympathy]],  it will seem more pathetic than funny and evoke pity rather than laughter.
