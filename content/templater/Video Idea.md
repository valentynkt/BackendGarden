## Concept

### Vegetables

Why do you want the video to exist?

Why would the user watch it?

### Title & Thumbnail

How will it be packaged?

### Hook

**What will the user come away with after watching this video?**

How will the "click" be confirmed and why will the user continue to watch this video? Will the emotion invoked in the title/thumbnail lead to different emotions in the hook?

What is the value proposition? What do you hope the viewer comes away with? Tell them that here in the first 30s of the video.

### Comment Goals

What question will you ask (related to the content) to user to get them to comment?
