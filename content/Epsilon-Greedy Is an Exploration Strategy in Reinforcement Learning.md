Epsilon-greedy serves as a common exploration strategy used in reinforcement learning algorithms, including [[Q-learning Balances Exploration and Exploitation|Q-learning]]. It addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma by providing a simple way to balance [[Novelty Search Over Objective Optimization|exploring new actions]] and exploiting the current best action.

The strategy introduces a parameter epsilon (ε) that determines the probability of choosing a random action versus the greedy action (the action with the highest estimated value).

With probability ε, the agent selects a random action uniformly from the available actions. This allows the agent to explore the environment and gather new information.

With probability 1-ε, the agent selects the greedy action, which maximizes the expected reward based on the current estimates. This exploitation step leverages the agent's current knowledge to make the best decision.

### The Epsilon Parameter Controls the Exploration Rate

The epsilon parameter in epsilon-greedy controls the exploration rate. A higher value of ε encourages more exploration, as the agent more frequently chooses random actions. Conversely, a lower value of ε favors exploitation, as the agent mostly selects the greedy action.

The choice of ε depends on the specific problem and the desired balance between exploration and exploitation. It can be a fixed value or decayed over time to gradually shift from exploration to exploitation.

### Epsilon-Greedy with Decaying Epsilon

A variant of epsilon-greedy involves decaying the value of ε over time. Instead of using a fixed exploration rate, the value of ε gradually decreases as the learning progresses.

This approach allows for **more exploration in the early stages** of learning when the agent's knowledge remains limited. As the agent gathers more experience and refines its estimates, the exploration rate decays, favoring exploitation of the learned policy. Decaying ε helps the agent transition smoothly from exploration to exploitation.

Epsilon-greedy stands out for its simplicity and ease of implementation. It requires *minimal computational overhead* and can be easily incorporated into various reinforcement learning algorithms.

Due to its effectiveness and simplicity, epsilon-greedy finds widespread use in practice. It offers a reliable baseline exploration strategy and often serves as a starting point for more advanced exploration techniques. Its straightforward nature makes it accessible to practitioners and researchers alike.
