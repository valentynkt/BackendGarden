# What is Active Procrastination?

This mode out of procrastination is **intentional**. It is invoked by people who prefer to work under pressure. They realize that they have more motivation and work better when there is a sense of urgency to what they are doing.

> I can get this done the night before and it's due in two months. Why should I work on it now?

This differs from [[Passive Procrastination|passive procrastination in intentionality]] and [[Active Procrastination Outcomes|outcome]].
