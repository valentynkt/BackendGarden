![[Executive function error.png]]

**executive function**: a set of cognitive processes that help us self-regulate so we can effectively plan, prioritize, and sustain effort toward our (long term) goals.

The cognitive processes that make up executive function are:

- **Response Inhibition**: helps us not be impulsive
- **Working Memory**: remember info while we are working with it (e.g. not being a goldfish)
- **Set Shifting**: switching between tasks with different cognitive demands
- **Delay Aversion**: delaying immediate gratification to achieve long-term rewards

This has ramifications for [[Finding motivation for someone with ADHD can be very difficult|motivation]] and makes ADHDers [[ADHD Immature|seem more immature]] to their neurotypical counterparts.
