Our emotional state plays a *significant* role in shaping the [[Emotions vs Feelings vs Thoughts|feelings and thoughts]] we experience.

These thoughts and feelings contribute to our unique understanding of the world, and by [[What does it mean to process thoughts|integrating them]] into our **personal narrative**, we can cultivate a richer, more nuanced perspective on reality.

While we should [[Know Thyself#How to get to know yourself|examine our thoughts]] to [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|understand them and ultimately ourselves]], we also need to [[Emotions need to be felt|feel any unfelt emotions]] that may be driving us subconsciously so that we can ultimately release them and write our story in a conscious way.

[[Emotions are irrational]] and can lead us to assumptions about ourselves and the world that are not useful if we don't take the time to understand them.

## Hypothetical Example

I'm getting ready to make a speech in front of a large audience.

Before I go on stage, I begin to experience an emotional response of a higher heart rate, a release of cortisol, and the general activation of my fight-or-flight response of the [[Limbic System Governs Emotion|limbic system]].

In my mind, I internalize this emotion by *feeling* it â€” associating a feeling to the emotional response. I begin to *feel* **fear** and **anxiety** associated with giving a speech.

My rational brain tries to interpret what is happening and begins to have thoughts such as:

> I'm feeling nervous. I must be nervous because I'm worried about messing up. I'm worried about messing up because I know I'm not that good or don't have as much expertise in the subject I'm about to give a speech on (impostor syndrome).
> 
> What if they find out I'm an idiot?
> 
> There are a lot of other smarter people than me. Why should *I* be presenting right now?

This recursive thought spiral can in-turn cause more emotional responses and feelings such as feeling a **fear of abandonment** of my social status or relationships if I don't perform well.

This cascade of emotions and feelings [[Emotions need to be felt|needs to be felt]]. They will come in waves and as long as I let them pass, they will pass.

After I get past my emotional response, I can begin to see that the [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|thoughts I'm having are not valid]]. In fact, the feeling of **excitement** has the exact same emotional state as **anxiety**: higher heart rate, cortisol, etc.

Feeling the feelings, validating them, and understanding that our [[Emotions are irrational|thoughts are irrational]] in an emotional state yields [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|understanding]].

I can then move past the emotional response and begin to give my speech feeling **excited** rather than **anxious**.
