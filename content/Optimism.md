Optimism acts as a mental attitude focusing on the positive aspects of life. People who practice optimism tend to hold a belief in positive outcomes, regardless of the difficulties they currently face. This attitude [[Optimism Uncovers Hidden Opportunities|does not ignore reality's challenges]] but chooses to approach them with a hopeful and positive mindset.

Optimism differs from naivety. While naivety often involves a lack of experience, understanding, or judgment about the realities of a situation, [[Optimism Is a Strategy to Navigate Challenges|optimism represents a conscious choice]]. Optimists understand the potential for negative outcomes but **choose to focus** on positive possibilities and solutions.
