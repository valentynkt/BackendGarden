# Religion breaks your brain and kills your curiosity

Religion provides an answer for everything (even if that answer is an unsatisfying "god did it"). It encourages easy answers over [[Ideas and knowledge on their own are not useful|doing the work of thinking]].

In doing so, it conditions people to not think for themselves and instead follow the group-think. This causes people to live unexamined lives where [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|they never learn the true nature of themselves]].

Religion is a detriment to society.

Inspired by [Jemar Tisby](https://twitter.com/JemarTisby/status/1569727675333492740?t=9jIa1UziNgf46dPsJK-ZyQ&s=19):
> Someone who is not Christian described their general experience with white evangelicals as "people who don't have any questions." I immediately knew what they meant, and I'm going to thinking about that statement a long time.
