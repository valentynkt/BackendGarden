This repository exists somewhere between a Zettelkasten and a [[Digital Gardening|digital garden]] and aids me in learning and producing knowledge.

For me, maintaining this Zettelkasten is not so much about collecting facts or researching academic ideas.

This is about **[[Know Thyself|discovering myself]]** and how I think about the world.

I want to [[Emotions deeply affect our thoughts, actions, and world view|understand how my emotions affect me]] and how my [[ADHD Executive Function|ADHD]] combined with my feelings have turned me into who I am and [[Actions Define Us|how I behave]].

I'm hoping to write down and [[What does it mean to process thoughts|process all my thoughts]]. Combined with [[Journaling is an effective way to process our emotions|journaling]] and [[Psychotherapy is an effective tool for processing emotions|psychotherapy]], I hope to gain insights into how I think about the world and perhaps examine my perceptions and biases.

More succinctly, I want a better [[One must understand their emotions to understand themselves|understanding of myself]] and how I view the world.
