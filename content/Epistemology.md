Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, and is considered a major subfield along with others such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.
## Knowledge on its own is not useful

The value in ideas and knowledge come from understanding how they fit together.

[[Ideas are Fragile|Ideas start out as fragile]] and fleeting. They need to be nurtured and connected to other ideas to truly thrive.

The value and insights of ideas come from their connection: the relationship between them. Bridging seemingly disparate ideas and seeing a connection that wasn't previously seen is where insights and creativity come from.

It's the difference between *knowing* something and *understanding* something.

The [[Idea Compass as a Thought Framework|idea compass is a useful thought framework]] for connecting ideas.

This is very similar to [[Positive social connections keep us healthy|human relationships]] where the value comes from the connection. Applied to your most important relationship (the [[Accept yourself for who you are|relationship to yourself]]), it's the difference between knowing that something "bothers" you and [[Understanding Emotions is Key to Self-Knowledge|understanding why/how]] and being able to move past it.

Neurons (artificial and natural) also produce value not from themselves, but in the way they are [[Network emergent behavior|connected to other neurons]].

Computers become far more useful when they are networked together.

The [[Art as expression of emotion|fundamental idea of art]] is taking existing things and combining them in new and creative ways where the [[Network emergent behavior|sum is greater than its parts]].
