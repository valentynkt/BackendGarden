**Normalcy bias** refers to the tendency to believe that the future will closely resemble the present and past.

This bias stems from our [[The Mismatch Between Our Evolutionary Heritage and Modern World|evolutionary history]] and [[Cognitive Biases Evolved as Survival Mechanisms|helped us survive]] in a world where most changes were either gradual or temporary, with the environment eventually returning to its previous state.

As a result, we struggle to intuitively grasp the idea of **fundamental** and **permanent** changes, even when we have experienced *significant* technological advancements in our lifetimes.
