We learn from a young age how to **obey**. The path to maturity as a child involves doing a lot of things that authority figures dictate we do for our growth.

If we are always "good," we never learn to say "no" to things we don't agree with or don't want to do. We people-please and never [[Know Thyself|understand what makes us happy]] much less pursue it.

We are the only ones with [[Self-knowledge yields independence of mind|our own best interests in mind]].

Freedom means **not being beholden to the expectation of others**. To be free is to be devoted to meeting our own expectations.
