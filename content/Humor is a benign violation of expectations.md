At its core, humor relies on the **element of surprise**. When we encounter something unexpected or incongruous, it can trigger a humorous response. This violation of expectations can take many forms, from a clever play on words to a physical pratfall.

However, for the violation of expectations to be humorous, it must also be *benign*. If the violation is too severe or threatening, it can provoke **anxiety**, **fear**, or **anger** instead of laughter. For example, a pratfall that results in serious injury is unlikely to be funny, while a harmless slip on a banana peel is a classic comedy trope.

The benign violation theory of humor also helps to explain why humor varies so widely across cultures and individuals. What one person or culture considers a benign violation may be seen as [[Laughter is based on aggression|offensive or threatening]] by another. This is why jokes that rely on stereotypes or sensitive topics can be so divisive - they may be seen as benign by some, but as harmful violations by others.

[[Laughter helps bond people together]] while satirical humor can [[Humor challenges social norms and power structures|challenge social norms and power structures]].
