[[Moore's Law]], beyond being an observation and prediction, has become a **self-fulfilling prophecy** in the semiconductor industry. The widespread acceptance and reliance on Moore's Law has **driven the industry** to invest heavily in research and development to maintain the predicted pace of advancement. Semiconductor companies have used Moore's Law as a *benchmark* for setting their own goals and timelines for developing new technologies and products.

This self-fulfilling nature of Moore's Law has **created a sense of inevitability** about the continued exponential growth of computing power. It has also led to a highly competitive industry, with companies racing to keep up with or exceed the expectations set by Moore's Law. The economic incentives created by the self-fulfilling prophecy have **fueled innovation** and **pushed the boundaries** of what is possible in semiconductor technology.
